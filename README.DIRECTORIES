Directory Structure of an Installed Majordomo System
====================================================

There are two possibly disjoint directory tries whose locations are
determined at install time.  One tree holds the executables and libraries
(the "code tree") whose structure largely is determined by the Perl
installation system.  The other holds the domains, lists, configuration
files, etc. (the "data tree").


Layout of the code tree:

  installation-defined root
  |         
  +-- bin  (executables)
  |   |
  |   +-- mj_shell   (shell interface)
  |   |
  |   +-- .mj_shell  (actual script) *
  |   |
  |   +-- (etc)
  |
  |
  +-- lib  (library files)
  |
  +-- man  (manual pages for Majordomo executables and modules)
  |
  +-- majordomo.crontab (a sample crontab file)


 *) If the setuid wrappers were built, the actual scripts will have a
    period prepended to their names.  Otherwise the script itself will be
    setuid.  The scripts which are wrapped/made setuid will differ
    depending on which MTA the system is running under.


Layout of the data tree:

This assumes a Majordomo system serving the imaginary domain "dom.ain".

  +-- LIB  (domain-specific Perl code)

 *) For databases, the final letter indicates the backend.  Some backends
    may require additional files or not use files at all.

 **) Dotfiles hold a description and MIME typing info.  They are not
     required to exist; default information is used if they do not.

 %) Majordomo saves information about every transaction (message headers,
    CGI environment, etc) in session files.  Sessions expire after some
    configurable time.

 +) Format of queue file names, basically same as Sendmail:
     OAA-12345-mylist
     ||  |     |
     ||  pid   list name
     |unique id
     hour of day, midnight=A

    Messages queued to the majordomo address don't have '-listname' part.
