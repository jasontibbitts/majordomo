The code itself is a bit inconsistent.  Only lists can pass the
  core-interface boundary, but the core code can do what it will.  Some
  functions take too many arguments (should be named) or should take list
  or hash refs instead of lists or hashes.

Input from attachment and here docs are not consistently implemented; they
  work for some functions but not others.  The ALL meta-list doesn't work
  at all, though the parser accepts it.

Things blow up when presented with unparseable MIME.  I've requested
  that a 'lax' mode be added to MIME::Parser so that if the message is
  illegal something comes back from the parser.  The idea is to try to
  get the message through even if it is illegal.

substitute_vars_string might not do the right thing when faced with
  keys that are subsets of others.

Createlist causes 'used only once' warnings?  Unverified and
  unreproduceable.

Empty returns from email commands?  Unverified and unreproduceable.

Undefined warnings from inform if lists is called with no lists.  This
happens because @out is legally empty, but inform takes $out[0] as the
status.  Lists should be fixed to return an $ok variable like
everything else.
