The code itself is a bit inconsistent.  Only lists can pass the
  core-interface boundary, but the core code can do what it will.  Some
  functions take too many arguments (should be named) or should take list
  or hash refs instead of lists or hashes.

Messages with unparseable MIME are ignored by the code.  I've requested
  that a 'lax' mode be added to MIME::Parser so that if the message is
  illegal something comes back from the parser.  The idea is to try to
  get the message through even if it is illegal.

The spooled message is not deleted after a message is forwarded by the
  "forward" access_rules action.

Visiting an external link from the WWW interfaces can cause a temporary
  password ("latchkey") to be revealed in the "Referer" information.
