No project with the history and magnitude of Majordomo can be completed by
one person.  The following have each contributed something to the Majordomo
effort:

Brent Chapman
  who came up with Majordomo in the first place.
John Rouillard
  who did much work on the original Majordomo1 code.
Chan Wilson
  who maintained Majordomo into the 1.94 days.
Dave Wolfe
  who gives constant comments, input, stats gathering code, and a pile of
  other things.
Eryq
  who wrote the MIME modules, without which most of the cool things
  Majordomo2 does would be very much more difficult.
Graham Barr
  who wrote the MAIL modules, without which the MIME modules would be very
  much more difficult.
Dave Barr
  (no relation, apparently) who maintains the Majordomo1 FAQ.
Jerry Peek
  who wrote the Majordomo chapters of the O'Reilly MIIS book, let Jason
  review it, and injected some sensibility into the development process.

Jason Tibbitts
  who designed and implemented the original Majordomo2 codebase and
  maintains the searchable Majordomo-(users|workers) archives.

  who wrote the original confirmation token patches and the extended lists

  the bouncefilter code.

Brian Heess
  who originally wrote the setid wrapper code.

responsible for making the whole better.

  rewriting Majordomo entailed.
Pat and Gunnar
