  who did much work on the original Majordomo1 code.

  who maintained Majordomo into the 1.94 days.
Dave Wolfe
  who gives constant comments, input, stats gathering code, and a pile of
  other things.
Eryq
  who wrote the MIME modules, without which most of the cool things
  Majordomo2 does would be very much more difficult.
Graham Barr
  who wrote the MAIL modules, without which the MIME modules would be very
  much more difficult.
Dave Barr
  (no relation, apparently) who maintains the Majordomo1 FAQ.

  who wrote the Majordomo chapters of the O'Reilly MIIS book, let Jason
  review it, and injected some sensibility into the development process.

Jason Tibbitts
  who designed and implemented the original Majordomo2 codebase and
  maintains the searchable Majordomo-(users|workers) archives.
