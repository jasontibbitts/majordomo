In Red Hat Linux 6.0 and 6.1, there is a bug in the MakeMaker module that 
will cause the Majordomo 2 man pages to be installed in the wrong location.  
This problem only occurs if Majordomo 2 is installed somewhere under the 
/usr directory.

To work around this problem, before running the "make" command, edit the 
Makefile.  For the INSTALLMAN1DIR and INSTALLMAN3DIR variables, change 
"$(PREFIX)" to "/usr".  For example, if you are installing in the 
/usr/local/majordomo directory, change

INSTALLMAN1DIR = $(PREFIX)/local/majordomo/man/man1
INSTALLMAN3DIR = $(PREFIX)/local/majordomo/man/man3

to

INSTALLMAN1DIR = /usr/local/majordomo/man/man1
INSTALLMAN3DIR = /usr/local/majordomo/man/man3

and then run "make" and "make install" as usual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In Red Hat Linux 9, there appears to be a pattern matching bug related
to character sets in perl 5.8.0 that will cause all e-mail addresses to
be considered invalid, giving error messages like the following: 

  The address "majordomo" is invalid.

  The address contains an unrecognized component.

  Location of the error: "majordomo@example.com"

One way to work around this problem is to install perl 5.6.1,
or perl 5.8.3 or later, then use it to configure and install Mj2.

Another option is to change the file /etc/sysconfig/i18n so the
LANG environment variable has a different default value, e.g.,
  LANG=C
