Welcome to the Majordomo 2 administrative interface at $SITE!
To return to this introduction at any time, select
<b>about this service</b> from the menu above and press the
<b>Issue Command</b> button.
<p>
At the top of this page is a command form that will allow you to issue
commands to administrate the $LIST mailing list.
Some commands, like <b>lists-aux</b>, have a hyphen in their names.
The part that follows the hyphen is called the "command mode."
<p>
To learn more about a particular command, select <b>help</b> in
the command menu, type the name of the command (without
the command mode) in the box immediately to the right,
and press the <b>Issue Command</b> button. You will
see a summary of how the command works.
The same commands may be issued by sending electronic mail to
<a href="mailto:$MJ">$MJ</a>.
<p>
Choose a command from the command menu.
Since most commands require a password, type the password
for the $LIST mailing list into the <b>Password:</b> box.
To administer a different list,
type its name into the <b>Mailing List:</b> box.
If additional information is needed to issue
a command, type that information into the box
immediately to the right of the command menu.
Finally, press the "Issue Command" button.
<p>
If the <b>Show Pending Requests</b>
button is pressed, the pending requests for your list will
appear at the bottom of the page.  There are many kinds of
requests:  a subscription or set request that
a subscriber has not yet confirmed; a request
for help that was sent to the mailing list by mistake; or
a posted message that is held for your approval because a
header line was too long, for example.
<p>
If there are requests, you will see a form
like this:
<form method=POST action="$CGIURL">
<input type=submit name=func value="tokeninfo-full">
<input type=submit name=func value="tokeninfo">
<input type=submit name=func value="accept">
<input type=submit name=func value="accept-archive">
<input type=submit name=func value="reject">
<input type=hidden name=domain value="$DOMAIN">
<input type=hidden name=list value="$LIST">
<input type=hidden name=passw value="yourpassword">
<input type=hidden name=st value="">
<br>
Choose one or more requests from the following list,
then press one of the buttons.
<table>
<tr><td colspan=5>Requests for $LIST
<tr>
<td><input type=checkbox name=extra value=13D7-C445-6A37>13D7-C445-6A37
<td>O
<td>post (5 kB)
<td>05-12 20:27:46
<td>Someone You Know &lt;someone@example.com&gt;
<tr>
<td><input type=checkbox name=extra value=8E49-E388-BADC>8E49-E388-BADC
<td>S
<td>subscribe
<td>05-13 10:27:46
<td>Someone New &lt;unknown@example.org&gt;
</table>
</form>

<ul>
<li>The first column has a checkbox and
the "token identifier," which is unique to that request.
Checkboxes allow more than one request to be handled at once.

<li>Generally, <b>subscribe</b> and <b>set</b> requests need
to be confirmed by the subscribers themselves, but any other request
should be handled by the list owners.  This is indicated
in the second column by an <b>O</b> (the owners must approve)
or an <b>S</b> (the subscriber must approve).

<li>The third column shows the type of request.  If the
request is a <b>post</b>ed message, the size of the message is
also shown.

<li>The remaining columns contain the date of
the request and the e-mail address of the person who made it.
</ul>

<p>
There are five buttons available to deal with pending requests.
<ol>
<li>The <b>tokeninfo-full</b> button will show the headers of the message
that caused the request, plus the message itself if the request
is a <b>post</b>.
<li>The <b>tokeninfo</b> button will show the headers of the message
and a summary of the request.
<li>The <b>accept</b> button will approve the request.
<li>The <b>accept-archive</b> button will approve the request, but
if it is a <b>post</b>, the message will be stored in
the archive but not distributed to the subscribers.
<li>The <b>reject</b> button will deny the request.
</ol>
<p>
If there are no pending requests, you will see the following message:
<pre>
There are no pending requests for $LIST.
</pre>
<p>
Requests will eventually expire unless someone handles them.
By default, the lifetime of a request is one week.
