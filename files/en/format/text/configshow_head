# More information about any configuration setting may be obtained
# using the help command.  For example, to learn more about the
# access_rules setting, use either of these two, equivalent commands:
#   help access_rules
#   help configset access_rules
#
# The settings are divided into several categories.  A list of categories
# may be obtained with the configshow-categories command.
