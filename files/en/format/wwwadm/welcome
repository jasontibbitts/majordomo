Welcome to the Majordomo 2 administrative interface at $SITE!
The links at the top and bottom of this document will help you to 
manage one or more of your mailing lists.  The following paragraphs
describe each of the links in turn.

<h3 align=center>Instructions</h3>

To return to this introduction at any time, use the 
<b>Instructions</b> link at the top or bottom
of the page.  For a general introduction to Majordomo 
administration, see the $HELP:ADMIN and $HELP:ADMIN_COMMANDS help pages.

<h3 align=center>Moderation</h3>

If the <b>Moderation</b> link is clicked, 
the pending requests for your list will be displayed
There are several kinds of request, for example: 
<ul>
  <li>a subscription or set request that a subscriber has not yet confirmed.

  <li>a request to unsubscribe that was sent to the mailing list 
      address by mistake.

  <li>any message posted to a fully moderated mailing list that has not
      yet been approved.

</ul>

This feature makes use of the $HELP:SHOWTOKENS command.

<p>
If there are requests pending, you will see a form
that looks something like this:
<form method=POST action="/cgi-bin/test-cgi">
  <input type=submit name=func value="tokeninfo-full">
  <input type=submit name=func value="tokeninfo">
  <input type=submit name=func value="accept">
  <input type=submit name=func value="accept-archive">
  <input type=submit name=func value="reject">
  <input type=hidden name=domain value="$DOMAIN">
  <input type=hidden name=list value="$LIST">
  <input type=hidden name=passw value="yourpassword">
<br>
Choose one or more requests from the following list,
then press one of the buttons.

<table>
<tr>
  <td colspan=5>Requests for the $LIST list
<tr>
  <td><input type=checkbox name=extra value=13D7-C445-6A37>13D7-C445-6A37
  <td>consult
  <td>post (5 kB)
  <td>05-12 20:27:46
  <td>Someone You Know &lt;someone@example.com&gt;
<tr>
  <td><input type=checkbox name=extra value=8E49-E388-BADC>8E49-E388-BADC
  <td>confirm
  <td>subscribe
  <td>05-13 10:27:46
  <td>Someone New &lt;unknown@example.org&gt;
</table>

</form>

<ul>
  <li>The first column has a checkbox and
  the "token identifier," which is unique to that request.
  Checkboxes allow more than one request to be handled at once.

  <li>Generally, <b>subscribe</b> and <b>set</b> requests need
  to be confirmed by the subscribers themselves, but any other request
  should be handled by the list owners.  This is indicated
  in the second column by <b>consult</b> (the owners should approve)
  or <b>confirm</b> (the subscriber should approve).  There
  also may be $HELP:DELAY requests, which will be completed
  automatically by majordomo, and do not require your attention.

  <li>The third column shows the type of request.  If the
  request is a <b>post</b>ed message, the size of the message is
  also shown.

  <li>The remaining columns contain the date of
  the request and the e-mail address of the person who made it.
</ul>

<p>
There are five buttons available to deal with pending requests.

<ol>
  <li>The <b>tokeninfo-full</b> button will show the headers of the message
  that caused the request, plus the message itself if the request
  is a <b>post</b>.

  <li>The <b>tokeninfo</b> button will show the headers of the message
  and a summary of the request.

  <li>The <b>accept</b> button will approve the request.

  <li>The <b>accept-archive</b> button will approve the request, but
  if it is a <b>post</b>, the message will be stored in
  the archive but not distributed to the subscribers.

  <li>The <b>reject</b> button will cause the request to be discarded.
  A reply message may be sent to the person who made the request.
</ol>

<p>
If there are no pending requests, you will see the following message:

<pre>
There are no pending requests for the $LIST list.
Requests found: 0.
</pre>

<p>
Requests will eventually expire unless someone handles them.
By default, the lifetime of a request is one week.

<p>
More than one mailing list can be moderated at the same time, if you use
a password that applies to all of the lists.  To moderate more
than one list, add each list name in the name by which this
script is called, and place forward slashes between the list names.  
For example, if you manage mailing lists named 
<b>broccoli</b> and <b>rhubarb</b>, instead of 
<pre>
  $CGIURL
</pre>
the script URL would look like this:
<pre>
  $CGIURL/broccoli/rhubarb
</pre>

<h3 align=center>Subscribers</h3>

This feature, which uses the $HELP:WHO command, 
allows you to view or change the current list of subscribers
for your mailing list.  Each subscriber has several individual
<i>settings</i> (sometimes called <i>flags</i>), including a 
<i>delivery class</i> that determines how posted messages are
sent to that subscriber.  These settings can be changed using
the $HELP:SET command.  New e-mail addresses can be added to
the subscriber list using the $HELP:SUBSCRIBE command.
Existing subscribers can be removed using the $HELP:UNSUBSCRIBE command.

<h3 align=center>Configuration</h3>

Majordomo has over 100 configuration settings; to manage them 
more easily, they have been divided into several categories.
If the <b>Configuration</b> link is clicked, 
a list of these categories will be displayed.  By selecting
one or more categories, and using the $HELP:CONFIGSHOW command,
you can view and change the current settings.

<h3 align=center>Lists</h3>

All majordomo mailing lists for the $DOMAIN domain can be
displayed by choosing the <b>view all mailing lists</b> task.
This task uses the $HELP:LISTS command.  By viewing the 
mailing lists, you can see how your mailing list appears to
the public from Majordomo's subscriber interface.  Information
about your mailing list is visible there, such as the number
of subscribers, the digests available, the description of
the list, and the $HELP:FAQ, $HELP:INFO, and $HELP:INTRO documents.

<h3 align=center>Help</h3>

Majordomo has an extensive collection of help documents.
If managing Majordomo lists is a new experience for you, the
$HELP:ADMIN, $HELP:ADMIN_COMMANDS, and $HELP:HELP pages are
the best places to start.

<h3 align=center>Command Form</h3>

Although the other features of this WWW service will allow you
to perform many of the tasks, not every task is supported yet.
However, the <b>Command Form</b> offers a primitive way of 
issuing commands that may be easier for experienced administrators.
<p>
In particular, the $HELP:ARCHIVE, $HELP:DIGEST, and $HELP:REPORT
commands are supported only by the command form.

<h3 align=center>Sign In</h3>

If you finish administering a particular list and wish to change
to another, use the <b>Sign In</b> link.  You will be prompted
for a new mailing list name and password.
