  <td valign="top">Moderation
  </td>
  <td>
Occasionally, posted messages, subscriptions, and other requests
will need your approval before they are completed.  Press 
<b>Moderation</b> to see all of the unfinished requests for your
lists.  The requests labeled <b>consult</b> will need your attention,
whereas the requests labeled <b>confirm</b> need the attention of
the people who made them.

<p>
More than one mailing list can be moderated at the same time, if you use
a password that applies to all of the lists.  To moderate more
than one list, add each list name in the name by which this
script is called, and place forward slashes between the list names.  
For example, if you manage mailing lists named 
<b>broccoli</b> and <b>rhubarb</b>, instead of 
<pre>
  $CGIURL
</pre>
the location of this page would look like this:
<pre>
  $CGIURL/broccoli/rhubarb
</pre>

Although the other features of this WWW service will allow you
to perform many common tasks, not every task is supported yet.
However, the <b>Command Form</b> offers a primitive way of 
issuing commands that may be easier for experienced administrators.
<p>
In particular, the $HELP:GET, $HELP:INDEX, and $HELP:PUT
commands are supported only by the command form.
