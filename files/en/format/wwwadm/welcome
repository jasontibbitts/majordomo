Welcome to $SITE.
The links at the top and bottom of the page will help you to 
manage one or more of your mailing lists.  You can return
to this introduction at any time by pressing <b>Introduction</b>.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Sign In
  <td>

If you finish administering the $LIST list and wish to change
to another list, press <b>Sign In</b>.  You will be prompted
for a new mailing list name and password.  Your temporary password 
for this session will continue to be valid.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Sign Out
  <td>

If you finish administering the $LIST list and wish to end
this session, press <b>Sign Out</b>.  Your temporary password
for this session will be invalidated.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Moderation
  <td>
Occasionally, posted messages, subscriptions, and other requests
will need your approval before they are completed.  Press 
<b>Moderation</b> to see all of the unfinished requests for your
lists.  The requests labeled <b>consult</b> will need your attention,
whereas the requests labeled <b>confirm</b> need the attention of
the people who made them.

<p>
More than one mailing list can be moderated at the same time, if you use
a password that applies to all of the lists.  To moderate more
than one list, add each list name in the name by which this
script is called, and place forward slashes between the list names.  
For example, if you manage mailing lists named 
<b>broccoli</b> and <b>rhubarb</b>, instead of 
<pre>
  $CGIURL
</pre>
the location of this page would look like this:
<pre>
  $CGIURL/broccoli/rhubarb
</pre>

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Subscribers
  <td>

Press <b>Subscribers</b> to see the first 20 addresses of
people who have subscribed to your mailing list.  From there,

of the subscribers.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Configuration
  <td>

Majordomo has over 100 configuration settings which you can
use to fine-tune the performance of your mailing list.  To manage them 
more easily, they have been divided into several categories.
Press <b>Configuration</b> to see a list of these categories.
You can then view and change the current settings.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>List Info
  <td>

If your mailing list is public, pressing <b>List Info</b> will show
you how it will appear when people visit the 
<a href="$WWWUSR_URL">web interface for subscribers</a>.
<p>
You can also edit the welcome message and other documents, see
statistics for recent posted messages, or check the status 
of message digests through the links on the <b>List Info</b> page.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Command Form
  <td>

Although the other features of this WWW service will allow you
to perform many common tasks, not every task is supported yet.
However, the <b>Command Form</b> offers a primitive way of 
issuing commands that may be easier for experienced administrators.
<p>
In particular, the $HELP:ARCHIVE, $HELP:DIGEST, and $HELP:REPORT
commands are supported only by the command form.

<tr>
  <td valign=top>Help
