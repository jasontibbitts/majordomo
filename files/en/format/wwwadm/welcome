Although the other features of this WWW service will allow you
to perform many common tasks, not every task is supported yet.
However, the <b>Command Form</b> offers a primitive way of 
issuing commands that may be easier for experienced administrators.

In particular, the $HELP:GET, $HELP:INDEX, and $HELP:PUT
commands are supported only by the command form.
