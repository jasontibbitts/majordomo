<h4 align="center">Introduction to Mailing List Moderation</h4>

<p>

Whenever someone posts a message to a mailing list, writes
to the list owners for help, or sends a command (like
<b>subscribe</b> or <b>who</b>) to the list server, we say
that a <b>request</b> has been made.  A posted message is called
a <b>post</b> request; a message to the list owners is called
an <b>owner</b> request.

</p>

<p>

Some requests succeed immediately, but others are delayed
for a few hours or require someone's approval.  When this
happens, Majordomo randomly chooses a unique 12-digit identifier,
called a <b>token</b>, for that request.  Each token has a
specific <b>type</b>, depending upon whose approval is required,
as shown in the following table:

<table border>
<tr>
  <th>Token Type
  <th>Who Should Approve
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>confirm
  </td>
  <td>The subscriber (Usually the person who made the request)
  If you <b>accept</b> or <b>reject</b> a <b>confirm</b> token,
  it may confuse the subscriber.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>consult
  </td>
  <td>The administrators (Usually determined by the 
  $HELP:MODERATORS 
  configuration setting.)
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>delay
  </td>
  <td>Nobody (The request will be completed automatically.)
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>probe
  </td>
  <td>Nobody (The request will be completed automatically.)
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Please see the $HELP:SHOWTOKENS page for detailed information about
token types.

<p>

Three commands are available to manage tokens and the requests
they represent:

<dl>
  <dt>accept
  <dd>The accept command approves the request.  Unless other
  approvals are required, the request will be completed 
  immediately.  The accept command has two important variations:
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>accept-hide</b> command will prevent a posted message
    from appearing in a public archive of your mailing list.

    <li>The <b>accept-archive</b> command will store a posted
    message in the archive of your list, but the message will
    not be distributed to the subscribers.
  </ul>
  See the
  $HELP:ACCEPT
  help page for more information.

  <dt>reject
  <dd>The reject command causes the request to be discarded.
  The reject command has one important variation:
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>reject-quiet</b> command will prevent a notice from
    being sent to the subscriber that the request has been rejected.
  </ul>
  See the
  $HELP:REJECT
  help page for more information.

  <dt>tokeninfo
  <dd>The tokeninfo command causes detailed information about the
  request (the expiration date, how many approvals are required,
  the contents of a posted message, and so on) to be displayed.
  The tokeninfo command has one important variation:
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>tokeninfo-remind</b> command will cause a reminder
    message to be sent to an e-mail address that you specify.
    This feature is useful for sending confirmation instructions to
    subscribers or moderators who deleted the original instructions.
  </ul>
  See the
  $HELP:TOKENINFO
  help page for more information.

</dl>

Each command is represented by a button at the top or bottom of the
list of tokens.
</p>

<p>
Once a token has been accepted or rejected and the request has
been completed, the token will become invalid, because
it is no longer useful.
</p>

<p>
You can see all of the tokens for your list at any time by clicking the
<b>Moderation</b> link at the top or bottom of the page.
