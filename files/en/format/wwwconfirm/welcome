Welcome to the Majordomo 2 request confirmation interface at $SITE!
The form at the top of the page will help you to 
manage one or more unfulfilled Majordomo requests. 
  

<h3 align=center>Instructions</h3>

Each Majordomo request has a 12-digit token identifier that looks 
something like this:
<pre>
  2E48-FA94-4C39
</pre>
If the token you wish to accept or reject is not present
in the first box at the top of the page, type it into that
box immediately.  There are four buttons you can use to
manage requests.

<ol>
  <li>
    To return to this introduction at any time, press the 
    <b>welcome</b> button at the top of the page. 

  <li>
    To get more information about a pending request (who made
    the request, why it requires your confirmation, and so on),
    press the <b>tokeninfo-full</b> button.

  <li>
    To approve the request, press the <b>accept</b> button.

  <li>
    To disapprove the request, press the <b>reject</b> button.

</ol>
