<h4 align="center">Introduction to the Confirmation Interface</h4>
<p>
When people make requests of the Majordomo mailing list server at
$SITE, some requests must be confirmed before they will be completed.
Confirmation may be needed for any number of different reasons.  Two
of the more common reasons are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone wishes to subscribe to a mailing list.  Confirmation
  is required to make sure that the subscription request is not a
  forgery.</li>
  <li>A message is posted to a mailing list by someone who is not
  a subscriber.  Confirmation from the moderators of the mailing 
  list is required to make sure that the contents of the message are
  appropriate for the mailing list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Majordomo assigns a unique <b>token identifier</b> to every request
that requires someone's approval.  Token identifiers are fourteen
characters long, for example:</p>
<pre>
87E4-995C-BF31
</pre>
<p>If you received confirmation instructions in an e-mail message, the
token identifier should appear in the subject and body of that message.
</p>

<p>
There are three basic commands available for dealing with a request.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <b>accept</b> command will confirm the request 
  and cause it to be completed.</li>
  <li>The <b>reject</b> command will discard the request and
  prevent it from being completed.</li>
  <li>The <b>tokeninfo</b> command will display more information
  about the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not wish the request to be completed, you can simply
ignore it.  If you ignore the request, Majordomo may send one reminder
message to your e-mail address in a few days.  Eventually,
the time limit on the request will expire.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to accept or reject a request, click the <b>Sign In</b>
link at the top or bottom of this document and follow the instructions
to tell Majordomo the token identifier for the request.
