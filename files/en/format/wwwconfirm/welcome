<p>  
Each Majordomo request has a 12-digit <b>token</b> identifier that looks 
like this:
<pre>
  2E48-FA94-4C39
</pre>

If your token is not present in the box at the top of the page, type it 
into the box.   There are four buttons you can use to manage requests.

<ul>
  <li>
    To approve the request, press the <b>accept</b> button.
    If you would like to explain why the request was accepted,
    type your reasons into the large box.

  <li>
    To disapprove the request, press the <b>reject</b> button.  If you
    would like to explain why the request was rejected, type your reasons
    into the large box.  This may result in various acknowledgements being
    sent.

  <li>
    To disapprove the request without sending acknowledgments, press the
    <b>reject-quiet </b> button.

  <li>
    To get more information about a pending request (who made
    the request, why it requires your confirmation, and so on),
    press the <b>tokeninfo-full</b> button.

  <li>
    To return to this introduction at any time, press the 
    <b>welcome</b> button at the top of the page. 
</ul>
