See the 
$HELP:SET 
help page for a detailed explanation of the settings.

Normally, a checkbox will appear next to the name of each
setting, but the moderators can use the 
$HELP:ALLOWED_FLAGS
configuration setting to keep you from changing your settings.
Each setting that you cannot change will be marked with an <b>X</b> if 
the flag is set, and an <b>O</b> if it is not.
