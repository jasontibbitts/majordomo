Welcome to the Majordomo 2 subscriber interface at $SITE.  
The links at the top and bottom of this document will help you to 
join or leave our public mailing lists.  The following 
paragraphs describe each of the links in turn.
You can return to this page at any time by clicking the <b>Instructions</b>

<h4 align=center>Sign In</h4>

If you wish to subscribe to a mailing list or change your settings, you
will need to sign in with your e-mail address, and a password if Majordomo
has already assigned one to you.  Click the <b>Sign In</b> link, then
follow the instructions to sign in.

<h4 align=center>Subscribe to Mailing Lists</h4>

There are two ways to subscribe to a mailing list.

<p>
The first way is to take the following steps:
<ul>
  <li>Click the <b>Subscribe to Mailing Lists</b> button. 
  This will cause a list of public mailing lists at $SITE to
  be displayed.

  <li>Click the name of the list to which you want to subscribe.
  This will cause details about the mailing list to be shown,
  such as the list owners' address and the number of subscribers.

  <li>Find the subscription form at the bottom of the page,
  and follow the instructions there.
</ul>

<p>
The second way is, if you know the name of the list, to type
it into the <b>Mailing List</b> box in the following form,
then press the <b>search</b> button.

<form METHOD=post action="$CGIURL">
  <input type=hidden name=domain value="$DOMAIN">
  <input type=hidden name=func value="lists-full-long">

  <input type=hidden name=user value="$USER">
  Mailing List:

</form>

Experienced subscribers can use a Majordomo pattern to search the list
of mailing lists.  See the $HELP:PATTERNS help page for details
on Majordomo patterns.

<h4 align=center>Unsubscribe or Change Settings</h4>

This link will allow you to adjust your settings, change your address,
add an alias, unsubscribe from one or more mailing lists, or
to unregister your address from this site entirely.
<b>A valid password is necessary to use this feature.</b>

<h5>Obtaining a password</h5>

When you subscribe to a Majordomo mailing list, your e-mail address
is recorded in Majordomo's registration database, and a password
is assigned to your address.  Regardless of how many subscriptions
you have at this site, you will have only one password.

<p>
If you have subscribed to at least one mailing list here, you
should have received your password in an e-mail welcome message.
If you do not know your password, you can obtain a new one using the 
$HELP:PASSWORD 
command.  

<p>
If you have not already subscribed to a mailing list at this
site, it is possible to obtain a password using the 
$HELP:SUBSCRIBE 
command to join a mailing list, or using the 
$HELP:REGISTER
command to add your address to the registration database.

<p>
You can obtain a new password or register using the following
form.  Type your e-mail address into the box, then press
the <b>password-gen</b> or the <b>register</b> button.

<form METHOD=post action="$CGIURL">
  <input type=hidden name=domain value="$DOMAIN">
  <input type=hidden name=passw value="$PASSWORD">
address:
  <input type=text size=32 name=user value="$USER">
  <input type=submit name=func value="password-gen">
  <input type=submit name=func value="register">
</form>

A confirmation message will be sent to your e-mail address.
