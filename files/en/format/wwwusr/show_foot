<p>
To add an $HELP:ALIAS (another e-mail address from which
you send messages), or to change addresses, type your new address into
the <b>New address</b> box
and press the <b>alias</b> or <b>$HELP:CHANGEADDR</b> button.
Majordomo may send a message to your new address asking for
confirmation.<br>
New address:
  <input size="36" name="extra">
  <input type="submit" name="func" value="alias">
  <input type="submit" name="func" value="changeaddr">

<p>
To change your $HELP:PASSWORD, type a password into the <b>New
password</b> box, then press the <b>password</b> button.  If you leave
the <b>New password</b> box empty, Majordomo will select a new password
for you.  Otherwise, the password you type must be at least $PWLENGTH
characters long.  Majordomo will send a copy of your new password to
your e-mail address.  You will need to sign in again, using your new
password, if you wish to make any other changes to your
subscriptions.<br> 

New password: 
<input size="16" type="password" name="newpasswd"> 
<input type="submit" name="func" value="password">

<p>
To $HELP:UNREGISTER, press the <b>unregister</b> button.  
All of your subscriptions and aliases will be removed, and
your password will be invalidated.<br>
  <input type="submit" name="func" value="unregister">
</form>

<p>
Normally, each setting is represented by a checkbox, but the 
list owners can use the
$HELP:ALLOWED_FLAGS 
configuration setting to keep you from changing your settings.
In that case, the setting will be marked with an <b>X</b> if the flag
is set, and an <b>O</b> if it is not.
