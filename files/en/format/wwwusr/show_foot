<h4 align=center>What do the settings mean?</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>delivery class 
  <dd>This setting determines how the messages posted to the list are 
      delivered to you.
    <dl>
      <dt>each message as it is posted (<b>each</b>)
      <dd>You will receive a separate copy of each message

      <dt>each unique message (<b>unique</b>)
      <dd>You will receive a separate copy of each message
      unless it has already been posted to another mailing
      list at $SITE to which you are subscribed.

      <dt>no messages (<b>nomail</b>)
      <dd>You will receive no mail at all from the list.

      <dt>anything else...(<b>digest</b>)
      <dd>You will receive the messages in a digest.  The names
      of the digests are determined by the list owners, in the
      $HELP:DIGESTS
      configuration setting.  See the 
      $HELP:SET help page for more details on digests.
    </dl>

  <dt>ackdeny
  <dd>  Select this to be notified when your
  posted messages are denied by the configuration settings of a list.

  <dt>ackpost
  <dd>  Select this to be notified when your
  posted messages have been accepted and are being delivered.

  <dt>ackreject
  <dd> Select this to be notified when your
  posted messages or majordomo requests are rejected by one of
  the list moderators.

  <dt>ackstall
  <dd>  Select this to be notified when your
  posted messages are being reviewed by the list moderators
  before they appear on a mailing list.

  <dt>eliminatecc
  <dd> Select this if you do not want two copies
  when someone sends a message both to you and to the list.

  <dt>hideaddress
  <dd>  Select this if you do not want your address to appear
  when someone reviews the list of subscribers with the 
  $HELP:WHO command.

  <dt>hideall
  <dd>  Select this if you do not want your name or address 
  to appear when someone reviews the list of subscribers
  with the
  $HELP:WHO command.

  <dt>postblock
  <dd>  This flag is set if the list moderators have decided to
  moderate or deny your posted messages by default.  Normally,
  only the list moderators can change this setting.  Questions
  about this setting should be addressed to 
  <a href="mailto:$OWNER">$OWNER</a>.

  <dt>prefix
  <dd>  Select this if you want to see a prefix which indicates
  the name of the mailing list in the Subject header of every message.
  This only matters if the list owners have configured the list to
  create a prefix.

  <dt>replyto
  <dd>  Select this if you want your replies to go to the
  mailing list instead of to the person who wrote the original message.
  This only matters if the list owners have configured the list to
  allow replies to go to the list.

  <dt>rewritefrom
  <dd>Select this if you want to change the From header
  in messages you send to the list.  The From header will then be
  rewritten to appear as it did when you subscribed to the list.

  <dt>selfcopy
  <dd> Select this if you want to receive a copy of messages
  that you post to the mailing list.
</ul>

Normally, each setting is represented by a checkbox, but the 
list owners can use the
$HELP:ALLOWED_FLAGS 
configuration setting to keep you from changing your settings.
In that case, the setting will be marked with an <b>X</b> if the flag
is set, and an <b>O</b> if it is not.
