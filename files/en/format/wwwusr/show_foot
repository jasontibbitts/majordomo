To add an $HELP:ALIAS (another e-mail address from which
you send messages), or to change addresses, type your new address into
the <b>New address</b> box
and press the <b>alias</b> or <b>$HELP:CHANGEADDR</b> button.
Majordomo may send a message to your new address asking for
confirmation.<br>
New address:
  <input size=36 name=extra>
  <input type=submit name=func value="alias">
  <input type=submit name=func value="changeaddr">

<p>
To change your $HELP:PASSWORD, type a password into the <b>New
password</b> box, then press the <b>password</b> button.  If you leave
the <b>New password</b> box empty, Majordomo will select a new password
for you.  Otherwise, the password you type must be at least $PWLENGTH
characters long.  Majordomo will send a copy of your new password to
your e-mail address.  You will need to sign in again, using your new
password, if you wish to make any other changes to your
subscriptions.<br> 

New password: 
<input size=16 type=password name=newpasswd> 
<input type=submit name=func value="password">

<p>
To $HELP:UNREGISTER, leave the box empty and press the <b>unregister</b>
button.  All of your subscriptions and aliases will be removed, and

      delivered to you.
    <dl>
      <dt>each message as it is posted (<b>each</b>)
      <dd>You will receive a separate copy of each message

      <dt>each unique message (<b>unique</b>)

      <dt>no messages (<b>nomail</b>)
      <dd>You will receive no mail at all from the list.

      <dt>resume receiving messages (<b>mail</b>)
      <dd>If the current delivery class is <b>nomail</b>, you
      will begin receiving messages again.  Otherwise, this
      setting has no effect.

      <dt>anything else...(<b>digest</b>)
      <dd>You will receive the messages in a digest.  The names
      of the digests are determined by the list owners, in the
      $HELP:DIGESTS
      configuration setting.  See the 
      $HELP:SET help page for more details on digests.
    </dl>

  before they appear on a mailing list.

  <dt>eliminatecc

  when someone sends a message both to you and to the list.

  <dt>hideaddress
  <dd>  Select this if you do not want your address to appear
  when someone reviews the list of subscribers with the 
  $HELP:WHO command.

  <dt>hideall

  to the mailing list to appear in a public archive.

  <dt>postblock
  <dd>  This flag is set if the list moderators have decided to
  moderate or deny your posted messages by default.  Normally,
  only the list moderators can change this setting.  Questions
  about this setting should be addressed to 
  <a href="mailto:$OWNER">$OWNER</a>.

  <dt>prefix
  <dd>  Select this if you want to see a prefix which indicates
  the name of the mailing list in the Subject header of every message.
  This only matters if the list owners have configured the list to
  create a prefix.

  <dt>replyto
  <dd>  Select this if you want your replies to go to the
  mailing list instead of to the person who wrote the original message.
  This only matters if the list owners have configured the list to
  allow replies to go to the list.

  <dt>rewritefrom

  in messages you send to the list.  The From header will then be
  rewritten to appear as it did when you subscribed to the list.

  <dt>selfcopy
  <dd> Select this if you want to receive a copy of messages
  that you post to the mailing list.
</ul>

Normally, each setting is represented by a checkbox, but the 
list owners can use the
$HELP:ALLOWED_FLAGS 
configuration setting to keep you from changing your settings.
In that case, the setting will be marked with an <b>X</b> if the flag
is set, and an <b>O</b> if it is not.
