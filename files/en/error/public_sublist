The "$LIST:$SUBLIST" auxiliary list is public, because it is listed in
the "sublists" configuration setting.  To destroy a public sublist,
first remove it from this setting.  If the sublist has an e-mail alias,
ask your domain manager to rebuild the aliases with the "createlist-regen"
command after you change the setting.
