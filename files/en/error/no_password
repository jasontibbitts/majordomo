An administrative password is required to use the $COMMAND command.

Please use the "help admin_passwords" command to see an introduction
to administrative passwords.

Administrative passwords may have insufficient privileges if the
access_password_override setting is turned off.  Please use the
"help configset_access_password_override" command for more details.
