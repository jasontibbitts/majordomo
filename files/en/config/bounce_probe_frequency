This variable controls how often bounce probes are sent out.

Bounce probing entails sending specially formatted messages such that the
address causing a bounce is immediately obvious when the bounce is
received.  This requires that each mail transaction send to only one
address, which places additional load on the mail server.  To counter this,
bounce probing is implemented in an incremental fashion.

The address list is split into 'bounce_probe_frequency' pieces, and a
different piece is probed for each message sent to the list.  This lowers
the overall load while still allowing complete probes to be done in a
reasonable amount of time.

The proper setting depends on a number of factors; it is generally
desireable to probe the entire list once every several days and definitely
not more frequently than once a day.  Thus this should not be set lower
than the expected number of messages per day.  The upper bound depends on
how much additional load the mail server(s) can tolerate.

Setting this to zero disables regular bounce probing.  Setting this to one
probes every address for every message and may place an extreme load on the
server(s).  Note that this variable will be ignored if the MTA is qmail,
because qmail does an equivalent kind of bounce probing itself.
