When a message is delivered to the subscribers of a mailing list, the
list of subscribers is split into several groups, and a different group
of addresses is probed for each message sent to the list.  For example,
if this value is 8, approximately one-eighth of the subscribers'
addresses will be probed every time.

Probing allows Majordomo to determine more easily which subscribers are
not receiving mail from a mailing list.

Setting this value to zero disables regular bounce probing.  Setting
this value to one probes every address for every message, and may place
an extreme load on the server.  

This setting will be ignored if the MTA is qmail, because qmail does an
equivalent kind of bounce probing automatically.
