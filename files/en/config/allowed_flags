A string containing the flags that users are allowed to adjust.  You
need only include the uppercase flags here:

  A - ack
  C - eliminatecc
  H - hide
  P - prefix
  R - replyto
  S - selfcopy

If this is completely empty, users cannot adjust any of their flags.
The list owner can of course do so.
