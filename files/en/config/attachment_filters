The attachment_filters setting contains a table of rules, which describe
how to process the different body parts of a posted message. 

A rule consists of a MIME type (or pattern matching a MIME type) 
and an action to perform when a message with this type or containing 
a part of this type is delivered to the subscribers of a mailing list.  
Each rule looks something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some common MIME types include text/plain, text/html, and image/jpeg.

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the body part pass untouched.
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest.
              (This has no effect upon single-part messages.)
  format    - convert the body part to plain text.  A numerical
              argument will adjust the right margin of the text,
              which occurs at position 72 by default.
