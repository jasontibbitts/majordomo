The inactive_lifetime setting specifies a number of days; inactive
subscriptions and registered addresses older than this age will be
removed.

A subscription is considered inactive if it has been in the "nomail"
delivery class and no date for the resumption of delivery was
specified.

A registered address is considered inactive if the address has no
subscriptions.
