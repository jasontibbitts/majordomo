THIS COMMAND IS OBSOLETE - flat text or BerkeleyDB databases must
be chosen during installation, and there is no configuration setting
which will change that choice. You can convert from text to DB files
while the server is NOT RUNNING - see README.UPGRADE in the
source distribution directory for details.
