These headers will be added to the e-mail headers of every posted
message or digest that is sent to the subscribers.

The headers in the GLOBAL "message_headers" setting will be added to
every message that the Majordomo server sends in response to a command.
Therefore, the GLOBAL "message_headers" setting should always contain a
Reply-To header that has the address of the Majordomo server.
