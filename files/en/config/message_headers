These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.

The header text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to
the message. See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which
are supported.
