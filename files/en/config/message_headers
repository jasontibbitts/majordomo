These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.

WARNING: A "Reply-To" header is REQUIRED for the GLOBAL pseudo-list
to function properly. Make sure you don't delete it if you replace
the defaults! This will be the address that confirmation tokens
(for commands like subscribe and set) go to with a default reply,
and without it confirmations may go to the list owner, depending
on the values in "configset sender", and "configset whoami".
