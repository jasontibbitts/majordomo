These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.

The GLOBAL "message_headers" setting should always contain a
Reply-To header that has the address of the Majordomo server.
