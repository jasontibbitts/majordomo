One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members to get "intro" files associated with
the named list or GLOBAL pseudo-list, while closed completely disables the
"intro" command for everyone. The "get" command can be used for files which
are also available via "faq", "intro", etc., depending on how your file
system is configured, and get_access does NOT restrict use of those other
ways to retrieve special files.
