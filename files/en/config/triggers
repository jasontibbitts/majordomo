Triggers are used to send reminders and to remove expired data from
the databases.  Each trigger consists of a name and a set of times
during which the trigger is issued.  The data are separated by
vertical bars ('|') or colons, as in:
  session  | monday(6,12,18), thursday(8)
Full syntax and possible names are described in "help configset triggers".
