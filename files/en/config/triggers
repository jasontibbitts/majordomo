Triggers are actions that occur periodically.  Each trigger consists 
of a name and a set of times during which the trigger is issued.  
The name and times are separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons, as in:
  session  | monday(6,12,18), thursday(8)
Full syntax and possible names are described in "help configset triggers".
