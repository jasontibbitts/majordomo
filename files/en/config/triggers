Triggers are actions that occur periodically, as often as once per hour.
They are used to remove expired data and complete delayed requests.

Each trigger consists of a name and a set of times during which the
trigger is issued.  The name and times are separated by vertical bars
('|') or colons, as in:
  session  | monday(6,12,18), thursday(8)

See "help times" for a description of the times syntax.
