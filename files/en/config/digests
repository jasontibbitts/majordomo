Data on the various digests that the list supports.  A digest is
defined by a name, a description, and several pieces of data that tell
Majordomo when an issue should be generated.  The following data can be given:

name     - A one-word name given to the digest.  It is unwise to name
           the digest "mime", "text" or "index".

times    - The times that digests are allowed to be created.  Times are
           specified as an integer from 0 to 23, the string "always" or
           the string "never".  The default is "always".

minsizes - The minimum amount of data (measured in messages or
           kilobytes) which must be collected before a digest will be
           generated.  The default is no minimum.

maxsizes - The maximum size of digest that will be created.  Specify
           either messages or kilobytes or both as with minsizes.  The
           default is no maximum.

maxage   - If an article is older than this, a digest will be created
           even if enough messages have not been collected.  This
           prevents messages from becoming "stale" on low traffic
           lists.  Specify hours like 12h, days like 4d and weeks like
           2w.  The default is no maximum age.

separate - The minimum amount of time that separates digests.

minage   - A digest will not be created if it most recent article is
           younger than this.  This is intended to prevent digest
           creation in the middle of active discussion.  The default
           is no minimum age.

deftype -- This specifies the type of digest that new subscribers get
           by default.  Currently only MIME, text and index digests are
           supported.  The default is MIME.

Each digest is defined by two lines.  The first contains data in the
following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:

name    | times  | minsizes | maxsizes | maxage | separate | minage | deftype

The second line holds a description of the digest.
