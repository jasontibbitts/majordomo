Data on the various digests that the list supports (not supported for sublists!).
Each digest is defined by two lines.  The first line contains data in the
following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:
  name    | times  | minsizes | maxsizes | maxage | separate | minage | deftype
The second line holds a description of the digest.

Full syntax is described in "help configset digests".
