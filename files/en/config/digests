The digests settings determine when digests of posted messages should be
delivered to the subscribers of a mailing list.

Each digest is described by two lines.  The lines contains data in
the following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:

  name | times | minsize | maxsize | maxage | separate | minage | deftype
  description | subject

The second line holds a description of the digest and the format of the
Subject header when the digest is mailed.
