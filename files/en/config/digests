The digests settings determine when digests of posted messages should be
delivered to the subscribers of a mailing list.

Each digest is described by two lines.  The first line contains data in
the following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:

  name | times | minsizes | maxsizes | maxage | separate | minage | deftype

The second line holds a description of the digest, which appears in the
Subject header when the digest is mailed.
