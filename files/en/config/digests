Data on the various digests that the list supports.  A digest is
defined by a name, a description, and several pieces of data that tell
Majordomo when an issue should be generated.  The following data can be given:

name     - A one-word name given to the digest.  It is unwise to name
           the digest "mime" or "nomime".

times    - The times that digests are allowed to be created.  Times are
           specified as any of the following:

            an integer from 0 to 23: digests will be created only
            during this hour of the day.  (0 is midnight.)

            two integers separated by a dash: digests will be created
            anytime between these two hours.  If the second number is
            less than the first, the range continues into the next
            day.

            the name (or a unique portion) of a day of the week, or a
            day of the month (as an ordinal): digests will be created
            anytime during that day.  fri, tue, 1st, 26th

            a construct like fri(6) or 22nd(12-18) limits digest
            creation to those hours on those days.

           Commas can be used to make lists of hours or days, so you
           can have:

            mo(6,8,10), tu(12-18,22-6), we, 3rd(4,10-14)

           The default is to allow digest creation anytime.

minsizes - The minimum amount of data (measured in messages or
           kilobytes) which must be collected before a digest will be
           generated.  10m gives a minimum size of 10 messages; 20k
           gives a minimum size of 20 kilobytes, and 10m, 20k will
           create a digest when either 10 messages or 20 kilobytes
           of message data have been collected.  The default is no
           minimum.

maxsizes - The maximum size of digest that will be created.  Specify
           either messages or kilobytes or both as with minsizes.  The
           default is no maximum.

maxage   - If an article is older than this, a digest will be created
           even if enough messages have not been collected.  This
           prevents messages from becoming "stale" on low traffic
           lists.  Specify hours like 12h, days like 4d and weeks like
           2w.  The default is no maximum age.

separate - The minimum amount of time that separates digests.  When
           messages come in quickly, or when a body of messages builds
           up during the times that digests are not allowed to be
           generated, it is possible that there are too many messages
           to be sent in a single digest and perhaps enough messages
           to fill more than one digest.  To prevent multiple digests
           from being generated too close to one another, set this to
           some amound of time.  To generate as many digests as
           necessary to clear out the backlog, leave this unset.

minage   - A digest will not be created if it most recent article is
           younger than this.  This is intended to prevent digest
           creation in the middle of active discussion.  The default
           is no minimum age.

deftype -- This specifies the type of digest that new subscribers get
           by default.  Currently only MIME and index digests are
           supported.  The default is MIME.

These settings take precedence in the following order:

  A digest is always created when triggered if there is a waiting
  message older than 'maxage', even if this means violating minimum
  size limits.

  Otherwise, digests will only be created if there are enough messages
  (minsizes), the last mesage which would be included in the digest is
  old enough (minage) and the time is right (time), meaning that the
  day is proper and either the hour is in a given range or a single
  hour was given and no digest has been triggered in that hour.

Each digest is defined by two lines.  The first contains data in the
following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:

name    | times  | minsizes | maxsizes | maxage | separate | minage | deftype

The second line holds a description of the digest.

Here is an example, defining two digests:

daily   | 23     | 20K, 5m  | 40K, 10m | 3d     | 1d       |        | mime
The test-list daily digest
weekly  | fr(23) |20k, 5m   | 100k,30m |        |          |        | index
The test-list weekly index
