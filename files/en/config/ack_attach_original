The ack_attach_original setting determines whether an acknowledgement
message will include (as a MIME attachment) the original posted message.
Acknowledgement messages are sent to give the authors of posted messages
details about the progress of their posts.  Whether or not an
acknowledgement message is sent depends upon the ackdeny, ackpost,
ackreject, and ackstall flags for the person who posted the message 
(see "help set" and "help configset_nonmember_flags" for more details.)

There are five values that can be used to determine which
acknowledgements will include a copy of a posted message:
  fail    - acks for messages denied by the access rules
  reject  - acks for messages rejected by the moderators
  stall   - acks for messages that are held for moderation
  succeed - acks for messages that are successfully delivered
  all     - all acknowledgements
