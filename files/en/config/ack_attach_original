The ack_attach_original setting determines whether an acknowledgement
message will include (as a MIME attachment) the original posted message.
Acknowledgement messages are sent to give the authors of posted messages
details about the progress of their posts.  Whether or not an
acknowledgement message is sent depends upon the ackdeny, ackpost,
ackreject, and ackstall flags for the person who posted the message 
(see "help set" and "help configset_nonmember_flags" for more details.)

There are five values that can be used to determine which
acknowledgements will include a copy of a posted message:
  all         all acknowledgements
  fail        acks for messages denied by the access rules
  reject      acks for messages rejected by the moderators
  stall       acks for messages that are held for moderation
  succeed     acks for messages that are successfully delivered
