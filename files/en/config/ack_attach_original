The ack_attach_original setting determines whether an acknowledgement
message will include (as a MIME attachment) the original posted message.
Acknowledgement messages are sent to give the authors of posted messages
details about the progress of their posts.  Whether or not an
acknowledgement message is sent depends upon the ackdeny, ackpost, and
ackstall flags for the person who posted the message (see "help set" and
"help configset_nonmember_flags" for more details.)

There are four values which can be listed for this setting:
  fail    - acks for denied messages will include the original.
  stall   - acks for moderated messages will include the original.
  succeed - acks for successful posts will include the original.
  all     - all acknowledgements will include the original message.
