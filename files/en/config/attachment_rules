A table containing attachment rules, which describe how various MIME
types are to be treated when they appear in messages sent to the list.

A rule consists of a MIME type (or regular expression matching a MIME
type) and a list of actions to perform when a message with this type
or containing a part of this type passes through the list.  It looks
something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some MIME types are:

text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, video/mpeg

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the part pass
  deny      - reject the entire message
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest
  consult   - send the entire message to the list owner for approval
  (more are planned)

allow and consult take an argument; if present, it should be a
content-transfer-encoding.  Majordomo will change the encoding of the
part to match before it is sent.  Some valid encodings are "8bit",
"base64", "quoted-printable", "x-uuencode" and "x-gzip64".  If an
argument is not provided, the encoding will be left as is.  Due to the
nature of MIME, be aware that the encoding can be changed at any
machine that the message passes through, so the encoding you choose
will not necessarily be the encoding that list members will see (and
some may see different encodings than the others).

Note that the first matching rule is the one that is used and types
are by default allowed if no rule matches.  Deny and consult rules are
applied first, and discard rules always apply, even for approved
messages.

Note also that deny and consult just set variables that can be checked
in access_rules.  The default rule for posting normally takes care of
these, but if you add any additional rules is is possible to override
the checks made here.
