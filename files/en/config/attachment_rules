The attachment_rules setting contains a list of rules, which describe 
what content types of a posted message are considered acceptable.

A rule consists of a MIME type (or pattern matching a MIME type) and an
action to perform when a message with this type or containing a part 
of this type passes through the list.  Each rule looks something 
like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some common MIME types are text/plain, text/html, and image/jpeg.

Possible actions are:

  allow   - Accept the body part.
  consult - Set the "mime_consult" access variable.  By default, this
            will cause the message to be sent to the list moderators
            for approval.
  deny    - Set the "mime_deny" access variable.  By default, this will
            cause the entire message to be discarded.
  require - Set the "mime_require" access variable.  By default, this 
            has no effect.

See "help configset_access_rules" and "help access_variables" for an
explanation of how to use access variables in the access rules.
