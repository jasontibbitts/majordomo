The attachment_rules setting contains a table of rules, which describe 
how to treat the different body parts of a posted message. 

A rule consists of a MIME type (or regular expression matching a MIME
type) and a list of actions to perform when a message with this type
or containing a part of this type passes through the list.  It looks
something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some MIME types are:

text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, video/mpeg

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the body part pass untouched.
  consult   - send the entire message to the list owner for approval.
  deny      - reject the entire message.
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest.
  format    - convert the body part to plain text.  A numerical
              argument will adjust the right margin of the text,
              which occurs at position 72 by default.
  require   - let the body part pass untouched.  Set the "mime_require"
              access variable for use in the access rules.
