A table containing attachment rules, which describe how various MIME
types are to be treated when they appear in messages sent to the list.

A rule consists of a MIME type (or regular expression matching a MIME
type) and a list of actions to perform when a message with this type
or containing a part of this type passes through the list.  It looks
something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some MIME types are:

text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, video/mpeg

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the part pass
  deny      - reject the entire message
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest
  consult   - send the entire message to the list owner for approval
  (more are planned)

allow and consult take an argument; if present, it should be a
content-transfer-encoding.
