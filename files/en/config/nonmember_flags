A list of flags which apply to users who are not list members when they 
send messages to the list.  Only acknowledgement flags, hidepost,
and postblock make sense in this case.  These flags include:

  ackdeny
  ackpost
  ackreject
  ackstall
  hidepost
  postblock

Use the "help set" command to see a detailed description of the flags.
