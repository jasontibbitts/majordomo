The advertise_subscribed setting affects the visibility of mailing lists
when the "lists" command is used.  If this setting is turned on, a
mailing list will always be visible to its subscribers.  If this setting
is turned off, a mailing list may not be visible to its subscribers,
depending upon the values of other settings.
