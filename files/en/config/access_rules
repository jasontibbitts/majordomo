A table containing access rules. Access to any command (such as "set"
or "subscribe" can be limited, and there are the two special cases
(see "help post" and "help access"). This is a very powerful and
unfortunately somewhat complicated mechanism for precisely restricting
access to Majordomo functions.

Full syntax is described in "help configset access_rules".
