The inform setting controls the ways in which list owners can keep
abreast of activity on a mailing list.  Each line consists of three
sections, separated by pipes or colons ('|' or ':')

  request | results | actions

The request is any majordomo command (e.g., subscribe, post, or
archive).  The results are one or more of "succeed," "fail," and
"stall," or "all" for all three.  The actions are one or more of
"ignore," "inform," and "report." Multiple results or actions should be
separated by commas.
