This controls just what actions the list owner will be informed of and
what will be logged.  The format of each line is:

request | status | actions

where request is subscribe, lists, post, etc., status is a comma
separated list of:

  succeed: perform the actions if the request succees.
  fail:    perform the actions if the request fails.
  stall:   perform the actions if the request is stalled.
  all:     always perform the actions

and actions is a comma separated list of:

  ignore: completelu ignore the request
  report: log the request for later reposting
  inform: inform the owner immediately

ignore overrides the others.
report is not yet implemented.

If a request is not specified, the default behavior for subscribe and
unsubscribe is to inform on success, report otherwise.  The default
behavior for all other requests is to report always.  This
approximates the 1.9x behavior.

Note that all actions are logged; this only affects which actions are
deemed important enough to send mail about and which will be reported.
