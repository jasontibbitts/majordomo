The inform setting controls the ways in which list owners can keep abreast of 
activity on a mailing list.  Each line consists of three sections, separated
by pipes or colons ('|' or ':')

  request | results | actions

The request is any majordomo command (e.g., subscribe, post, or archive).
The results are one or more of "succeed," "fail," and "stall," or "all" for 
all three.  The actions are one or more of "ignore," "inform," and "report."
Multiple results or actions should be separated by commas.
