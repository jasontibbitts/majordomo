This list of transformations is applied to all addresses before
comparing them for equivalency or storing them in the internal database.
This can be used to remove address extensions, to remove part of the
domain name, or to convert capital letters into small letters, for
example.

Each transform must appear on a separate line and should be in the form
/pattern/replacement/ unless a special string is used. 

Each transform must continue to give the same result when applied to the
same email address multiple times in succession.
