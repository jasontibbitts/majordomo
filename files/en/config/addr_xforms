A list of transformations to be applied to ALL addresses before comparing
them for equivalency or storing them in the internal database. This can
be used to remove the '+mailbox' part of an address, or to remove the
machine name from addresses in a domain, or even to make all addresses
fully case insensitive. Transforms should listed one per line, and should
be in the form /pattern/replacement/ unless a special string is used. 

NOTE: These transforms must continue to give the same result when applied
to the same email address multiple times in succession.
