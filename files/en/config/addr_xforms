The addr_xforms setting contains a list of transformations.  These
transformations are applied to all addresses before comparing them for
equivalence or storing them in the internal databases.  Transformations
can be used to remove address extensions, to remove part of the domain
name, or to convert capital letters into small letters, for example.

Each transformation must appear on a separate line and should be in the
form:
  /pattern/replacement/ 
unless a special name is used. 

Each transformation must continue to give the same result when applied
to the same email address multiple times in succession.
