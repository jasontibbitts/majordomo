The envelope and sender address for the resent mail.  This string has
"@" and the value of resend_host appended to it to make a complete
address if you do not supply a domain. When applied to the GLOBAL
pseudo-list, it provides the sender address for things like token
confirmation requests. When applied to a regular email list, it
supplies the sender address for regular posts in addition to the
welcome mail message generated as part of the subscribe command.
