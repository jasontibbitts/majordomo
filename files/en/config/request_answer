The request_answer setting controls what happens to messages sent to the
"listname-request" address of every mailing list in a domain.  Three 
values are supported:

  majordomo - Commands in the message body will be processed.

  owner     - The message will be sent to the list owners.

  response  - The contents of the "request_response" document will be
              delivered to the sender of the message.
