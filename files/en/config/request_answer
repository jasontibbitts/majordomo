The request_answer setting controls what happens to messages sent to the
"listname-request" address of every mailing list in a domain.  Three 
values are supported:

majordomo - Commands in the message body will be processed
owner     - The message will be sent to the list owners
response  - The contents of the "request_response" document will be
            delivered to the sender of the message.
