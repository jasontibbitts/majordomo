The config_access setting loosens or tightens access to configuration
settings.  Each line consists of a setting name, followed by three
levels:

  name | view level | change level | wizard level

The view level is the password level required to view a configuration
setting (with the configshow command).

The change level is the password level required to change a setting
(with the configset or configdef command). 

The wizard level describes the importance of a setting and the
skill level required to understand it.  

The password level is a whole number between 0 and 5 for
viewing, and between 1 and 5 for changing.

Higher numbers mean greater restrictions.  The password levels include:

  5  The site password
  4  The domain master password (from the GLOBAL master_password setting)
  3  A domain auxiliary password (from the GLOBAL passwords setting)
  2  A list master password
  1  A list auxiliary password
  0  No password

A high level password can be used to view or change a setting whose
password level is smaller. For example, a level 4 password can be used
to change a setting with a change level of 4 or less.

The wizard level is a whole number between 1 and 9.  Level 1 settings
are considered "essential" and should be configured by all new list
owners.  Settings with higher "wizard" levels are more complicated and
have a more specific scope.

For example, an entry like
  token_lifetime |  1  |  3  | 4
would allow anyone with an administrative password to see the
token_lifetime setting, but only the domain or site managers could
change it.
