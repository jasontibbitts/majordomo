The config_access setting loosens or tightens access to configuration
settings.  Each line consists of a setting name, followed by an
access level for viewing the setting (with the configshow command)
and an access level for changing the setting (with the configset or
configdef command).  The access level for is a whole number between 
0 and 5 for viewing, and between 1 and 5 for changing.

Higher numbers give greater restrictions.  The access levels include:
  5 - The site password
  4 - The domain master password (from the GLOBAL master_password setting)
  3 - A domain auxiliary password (from the GLOBAL passwords setting)
  2 - A list master password
  1 - A list auxiliary password
  0 - No password

For example, an entry like
  token_lifetime |  1  |  3
would allow anyone with an administrative password to see the token_lifetime
setting, but only the domain or site managers could change it.
