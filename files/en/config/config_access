The config_access setting loosens or tightens access to configuration
settings.  Each line consists of a setting name, followed by three
levels:

1. An access level for viewing the setting (with the configshow command). 

2. An access level for changing the setting (with the configset or 
   configdef command). 

3. A wizard level that describes the importance of a setting and the
   skill level required to understand it.  

The access level for is a whole number between 0 and 5 for
viewing, and between 1 and 5 for changing.

Higher numbers give greater restrictions.  The access levels include:
  5 - The site password
  4 - The domain master password (from the GLOBAL master_password setting)
  3 - A domain auxiliary password (from the GLOBAL passwords setting)
  2 - A list master password
  1 - A list auxiliary password
  0 - No password

The wizard level is a whole number between 1 and 9.  Level 1 settings
are considered "essential" and should be configured by all new list
owners.  Settings with higher "wizard" levels are more complicated and
have a more specific scope.

For example, an entry like
  token_lifetime |  1  |  3  | 4
would allow anyone with an administrative password to see the
token_lifetime setting, but only the domain or site managers could
change it.
