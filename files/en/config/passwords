A table of passwords, the actions they allow a user to perform, and an
optional list of user names which they are bound to.  The table should
look like so:

  password1 : action, action, action
  password2 : action, action : user@host.dom, blah@urk.org

If no users are listed, the password can be used by all users.  Any
addresses listed are put through the transformation and aliasing
processes before being used.

The following actions are permitted:

  config_xyz - allows the user to view and alter the contents of
    config variables in the group "xyz".

 XXX List all of the actions here!
