A table of (possibly encrypted) administrative passwords, the actions
they allow an administrator to perform, and an optional list of
addresses of administrators allowed to use the password.  The table
should look like:

  password1 : action, action, action
  password2 : action, action : user@host.dom, blah@example.edu

If no addresses are listed, the password can be used by anyone
who knows it.  

Passwords cannot begin with a '#'.  They also cannot contain a ':' or
'|'.
