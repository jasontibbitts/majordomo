The aliases setting contains a list of mail aliases to which electronic
mail can be sent.  The following values are supported:

  auxiliary   An alias for each auxiliary list in the "sublists" setting.
  moderator   LIST-moderator
  owner       LIST-owner
  request     LIST-request
  resend      LIST
  subscribe   LIST-subscribe
  unsubscribe LIST-unsubscribe

Currently, owner, request, and resend are mandatory.

After the value  of this setting has been changed, the createlist-regen
command must be run to recreate the aliases.
