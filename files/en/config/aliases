The aliases setting determines which e-mail addresses are available to
the public for a particular mailing list.  The following values are
supported:

  Alias                E-mail addresses for this alias
  -----                -------------------------------
  auxiliary            An alias for each sublist in the "sublists" setting.
  moderator            LIST-moderator
  owner                LIST-owner
  request              LIST-request
  resend               LIST
  subscribe            LIST-subscribe
  subscribe-digest     LIST-subscribe-digest
  subscribe-digest-all An alias for each digest in the "digests" setting.
  subscribe-each       LIST-subscribe-each
  subscribe-nomail     LIST-subscribe-nomail
  subscribe-unique     LIST-subscribe-unique
  unsubscribe          LIST-unsubscribe

Currently, the owner, request, and resend aliases are mandatory.

After the value of this setting has been changed, the createlist-regen
command must be run to recreate the aliases.
