The aliases setting contains a list of mail aliases to which electronic
mail can be sent.  The following values are supported:

  auxiliary            An alias for each auxiliary list in the "sublists"
                       setting.
  moderator            LIST-moderator
  owner                LIST-owner
  request              LIST-request
  resend               LIST
  subscribe            LIST-subscribe (adds user to the list in the default
                       class, as given by the default_class setting)
  subscribe-digest     LIST-subscribe-digest (adds user to the list,
                       receiving the default digest)
  subscribe-digest-all An alias for each existing digest, for example
                       LIST-subscribe-digest-daily.
  subscribe-nomail     LIST-subscribe-nomail (adds user, but they will
                       receive no mail)
  unsubscribe          LIST-unsubscribe

Currently, owner, request, and resend are mandatory.

After the value of this setting has been changed, the createlist-regen
command must be run to recreate the aliases.
