This is an array variable, but for backwards compatibility the
line is split on spaces, tabs, and colons.

If restrict_post is defined for a given list, only addresses belonging
to one of the listed sublists will be allowed to post to that list.
This functionality of restrict_post is completely encapsulated within
the access_rules mechanism, but it remains for backwards compatibility
and because it's simpler to use.
