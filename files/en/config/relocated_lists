The relocated_lists setting allows customized messages to be displayed
when someone issues a Majordomo command for a mailing list that has been
renamed, discontinued, or relocated.

Each line in this setting consists of three fields, separated by colons
or pipe symbols.  
  old_name | new_name | file
The first field is the name of a mailing list that is no longer valid.
The second, optional field is the new name of the mailing list.
The third, optional field is the path of a file that gives information
about the mailing list.
