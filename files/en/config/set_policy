One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
'+confirm'.  Open allows people to change their list settings,
but attempts to subscribe addresses diferent than where the request is
coming from will require approval.  Auto allows anybody to change
anyone's settings to the list without maintainer approval.  Closed 
requires maintainer approval for all set requests to the list.  Adding
'+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send a reply
back to the subscriber which includes a token.  The subscriber 
must then reply with 'accept' for the command to succeed.
