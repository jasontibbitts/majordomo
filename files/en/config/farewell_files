The farewell_files setting determines which documents are mailed when
someone leaves a mailing list with the "unsubscribe" command.

Each file takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory message
which will appear in the Subject or Content-description header of the
e-mail message that is sent to the ex-subscriber.  The second line
consists of a file name and a flag field, which are separated by a colon
(':') or pipe symbol ('|').
