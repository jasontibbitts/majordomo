This contains blocks of text, called fronters, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple fronters
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a fronter is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the fronters given here. The
frequency with which fronters appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_fronter_frequency".
