This contains blocks of text, called fronters, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple fronters
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a fronter is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the fronters given here.

The fronter text will undergo variable substitution (and possibly
auto-inclusion of OTHER files) as it is added to the message.
See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which are supported.

Note that for multipart messages, fronters appear as separate parts at
the beginning of the message and that fronters are not added at all to
single part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids
destroying the content of structured messages.)

The frequency with which fronters appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_fronter_frequency".
