The archive_size setting contains the maximum size in kilobytes, or
maximum number of messages in a single archive file.  When a posted
message arrives that would cause an archive file to exceed this size, a
new archive file will be created to hold the new message.

The size is a number followed by a 'k' for kilobytes or an 'm' for
messages.  The value 'unlimited' is also permitted.

Changing this setting will affect new messages; old archives will not be
renamed or altered in any way.
