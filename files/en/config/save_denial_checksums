If set (any value other than 0), the checksums for the body of a posted
message will be saved even if that message is denied by the access rules.
If the checksums are saved, any succeeding message with an identical
body will be regarded as a duplicate. If not set, or set to zero, posts
which are not distributed will not cause future posts to be rejected.
