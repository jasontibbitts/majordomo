If set (any value other than 0), the checksums for the body of a posted
message will be saved if that message is denied by the access rules.
If the checksums are saved, any succeeding message with an identical
body will be regarded as a duplicate.  If not set, or set to zero, even
posts which do not get distributed can cause future posts to be rejected.
