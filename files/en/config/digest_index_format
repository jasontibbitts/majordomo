Selects one of the formats for each line in the index listing for the
digests.  The 'subject' format consists simply of the subjects of the
messages.  The 'subject_author' format, originally provided by Jeff
Wasilko, provides an index like the following:

  A subject                                         [User <user@example.com>]
  Another subject                      [Another User <otheruser@example.org>]
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
                                       [A Verbose user <verbose@example.com>]
