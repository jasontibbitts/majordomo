A list of the classes that a user is allowed to put themselves into.
There are currently three classes (each, digest, nomail), and the
digest class may have list-owner-defined subclasses.

If a class (like 'digest') which has sub-classes is allowed, users
are allowed to put themselves into any of the more specific classes
(like 'digest-daily' or digest-weekly').
