The bounce_rules setting determines how error messages due to delivery 
failures should be processed.  Each rule consists of at least two lines.  
On the first line are one or more actions, separated by commas.  On the 
second and succeeding lines are conditions under which the actions occur.  
Blank lines are used to separate rules.
