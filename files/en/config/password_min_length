This sets the minimum length for personal passwords.  When a personal 
password is changed with the password command, the new password must be at 
least this long.  Passwords generated randomly will be at least 6 characters 
long, even if this value is smaller.  There is no maximum password length, 
but for security reasons it is wise to enforce a lower limit.
