The welcome_files setting determines which documents are mailed when
someone joins a mailing list with the "subscribe" command, or when
someone registers using the "register" command.

Each file takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory message
which will appear in the Subject or Content-description header of the
e-mail message that is sent to the new subscriber.  The second line
consists of a file name and a flag field, which are separated by a colon
(':') or pipe symbol ('|').
