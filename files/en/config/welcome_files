A table containing a list of files and descriptions that should be
sent to new subscribers, like so:

Welcome to the mailing list!

Mailing list FAQ
faq.txt

Each table record takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory
message, which will go in the subject or content-description header as
appropriate.  (If this is empty, the file's description will be used.)
The second is broken into fields by ":" or "|".

The first field is the name of the file, in the file space of the
list.

The second should be either "N", meaning that the file will be sent as
a separate piece of mail, or "P", meaning that the file will be
attached to the previous file.  The default is "N".  In addition, an
"S" can be added, indicating that the file should undergo variable
substitution.  Currently the following substitutions are supported:

 $USER    - the address of the user
 $LIST    - the list name
 $REQUEST - the list-request address
 $MJ      - the address of the majordomo server
 $OWNER   - the address of the list owner
 $MJOWNER - the address of the list owner
