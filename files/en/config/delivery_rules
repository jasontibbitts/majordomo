The delivery_rules setting determines how Majordomo will contact an SMTP
server which is capable of delivering the mail.  The delivery rules
apply to all messages which are mailed by Majordomo.  

The rules for an individual mailing list govern the delivery of posted
messages (including digests) and announcements sent with the announce
command.  The rules for the GLOBAL pseudo-list apply to all other
messages sent by Majordomo, including responses to commands,
confirmation notices, token reminders, and informational notices sent to
the list owners.
