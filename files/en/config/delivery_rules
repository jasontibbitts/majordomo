A table containing delivery rules, which describe how Majordomo will
deliver mail.  In the simplest form, you can specify a host to use for
delivery and a batch size.  (This duplicates much of the functionality
of bulk_mailer, for those familiar with it.) Smaller batch sizes will
keep malformed addresses from killing the entire delivery, but the
optimal batch size depends on your mail handler and net connections.

Each delivery destination should begin with a line containing either a
regular expression, or the word ALL.  Addreses are compared against
these in order; the first matching destination is chosen.  This
enables you to choose which addresses go to which sets of hosts.

The remaining lines (up until the next blank) should consist of
various parameters which affect delivery.  The possible parameters
are:

numbatches=N
  Split the address list up into exactly N batches.

maxaddrs=N
  Split the list into batches of N addresses apiece.

maxdomains=N
  Split the address list into batches of N domains apiece.

minseparate=N
  If a domain appears more than N times in various addresses, they
  will all be given a separate batch.

If neither of the above are specified, the default is numbatches=1,
which duplicates the Majordomo 1.x behavior.

hosts=(hosta, hostb, hostc)
  A list of hostnames that Majordomo will connect to to deliver
  batches.  If no hosts are given, Majordomo connects to localhost.

backup=(hostd, hoste, hostf)
  A list of backup hosts to use in case one or more of the regular
  delivery hosts are down.

sort
  Sort the address list.  Many of the batching options depend on
  getting the addresses in sorted order and will not work as expected
  if the address are unsorted.

Hosts in either the hosts or backup lists can also be specified with
additional information, as follows:

hosts=(hosta=(parameter1, param2=5), hostb=(param3), hostc)

The host parameters are as follows:

esmtp      - speak ESMTP with the hosts if it is able.
onex       - send ESMTP ONEX to the host if it supports it.
pipelining - send the ESMTP PIPELINING command to the host.
timeout    - the number of seconds to wait when opening a connection
             to the host
port       - the port number to connect to, if different from the
             usual SMTP port.

If, instead of a host name, the string "@qmail" is used, Majordomo
will open a direct connection to the qmail-queue program and directly
inject the message into the qmail delivery system.  This assumes, of
course, that you are running qmail.
