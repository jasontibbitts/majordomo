A table containing delivery rules, which describe how Majordomo will
deliver mail.  In the simplest form, you can specify a host to use for
delivery and a batch size.  (This duplicates much of the functionality
of bulk_mailer, for those familiar with it.) Smaller batch sizes will
keep malformed addresses from killing the entire delivery, but the
optimal batch size depends on your mail handler and net connections.
The full syntax is described in "help configset delivery_rules".

Each delivery destination should begin with a line containing either a
regular expression, or the word ALL.  Addreses are compared against
these in order; the first matching destination is chosen.  This
enables you to choose which addresses go to which sets of hosts.

The remaining lines (up until the next blank) should consist of
various parameters which affect delivery. Parameters can be backup,
hosts, maxaddrs, maxdomains, minseparate, numbatches, sort.
