The table of rules in the delivery_rules setting describes how Majordomo
will deliver mail.  In the simplest form, you can specify a host to use
for delivery and a batch size.  (This duplicates much of the
functionality of bulk_mailer, for those familiar with it.) Smaller batch
sizes will keep malformed addresses from killing the entire delivery,
but the optimal batch size depends on your mail handler and net
connections.

The first line of each rule should contain either a Majordomo pattern,
or the word ALL.  Each recipient's address is compared against the
pattern in each rule; the first matching rule determines how the message
is delivered to that recipient.  This enables you to choose which
addresses go to which sets of hosts.  The remaining lines (up until the
next blank line) should consist of various option which affect delivery.
Options include  backup, hosts, maxaddrs, maxdomains, minseparate,
numbatches, sort.
