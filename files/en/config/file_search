This provides a search-path mechanism for filename lookup.  Entries are of
the form

  list:path

where 'list' is the name of a list and path is the path within the
list's filespace.  'list' can be empty, in which case this list is used.
'path' can be empty, in which case the root of the filespace is used.
Thus ':' refers to the top of the filespace of this list.

To access files of another list, that list must must contain this
list's name in its file_share variable.  If the referenced list does
not share with this list, the relevant entries will be ignored.
