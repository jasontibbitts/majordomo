The "post_limits" setting establishes limits for how often a particular
person can post messages to a mailing list.  The format of each line is:

  pattern | soft_limits | hard_limits | lower_limits

The pattern will be matched against the e-mail address of the author of
the message.  The first line that matches will cause the soft and hard
upper limits on that line to be compared to the author's history of
posted messages.  By default, exceeding a soft limit will cause a posted
message to be moderated; exceeding a hard limit will cause a posted
message to be denied; and not meeting a lower limit will cause a posted
message to be moderated.
