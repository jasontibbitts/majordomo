This controls the per-address limits for posting messages to a list.
The format of each line is:
  pattern | conditions | conditions
The pattern will be matched against the e-mail address of the author
of the message.  The conditions will be applied if the pattern matches.

The conditions determine the "soft" and "hard" limits, respectively.
Each set of conditions is a comma-separated list of proportions
("3/10" means three messages out of the last ten) and frequencies
("5/2d12h" means five messages in the last two and a half days).
