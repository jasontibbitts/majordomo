The "post_limits" variable controls the per-address or per-domain limits
for posting messages to a list. The format of each line is:
  pattern | soft_limit_conditions[,more] | hard_limit_conditions[,more]
The pattern will be matched against the e-mail address of the author
of the message.  The conditions will be applied if the pattern matches.
(See "help configseet post_limits" for syntax details, and "help patterns"
for details on regular expressions.)
