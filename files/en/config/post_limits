The "post_limits" variable controls the per-address or per-domain limits
for posting messages to a list. The format of each line is:
  pattern | soft_limit_conditions[,more] | hard_limit_conditions[,more]
The pattern will be matched against the e-mail address of the author of
the message. The conditions will be applied if the pattern matches.

Full syntax is described in "help configset post_limits".
