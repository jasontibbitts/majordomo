When MTA configuration is suggested, this value will be used as the
debug parameter.  It is used to generate debugging information for
this list.  Higher values cause more debugging information to be
generated.  Values of 500 are generally sufficient for bug reporting;
at 1000 a complete SMTP trace is generated which is useful for
debugging MTA problems.

Note that this only effects the generation of the MTA configuration
information (i.e. suggested aliases) so that configuration information
will have to be updated for this value to have any effect. If the
MTA configuration is being automatically maintained by Majordomo,
it should be regenerated (using createlist-regen).
