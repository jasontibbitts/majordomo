This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to the
end of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers here by
separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be added, it is
chosen at random from the footers given here. The frequency with which
footers appear can be controlled with the message_footer_frequency
setting.
