This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the footers given here.

The following strings can be placed in footers; they well be
converted to the appropriate text when the footer is inserted into
the message:

  $LIST    - the name of the list
  $VERSION - the version of Majordomo
  $SENDER  - the person who sent the message

Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
the content of structured messages.)

The frequency with which footers appear can be controlled with the
variable "message_footer_frequency".
