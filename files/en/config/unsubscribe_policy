One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
'+confirm' or '+password'.  

Open allows people to unsubscribe themselves, but attempts to unsubscribe
one address from a different address will require administrative approval.  

Auto allows anybody to unsubscribe anyone else from the list. 

Closed requires maintainer approval for all unsubscribe requests.  

Adding '+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send 
a message to the affected address, asking for that person's approval.
The subscriber must then reply with 'accept' for the command to succeed.

open+password or auto+password requires that the command be issued using
the personal password for the affected address, or an admin password.
