If the administrivia setting is set to "yes", posted messages which
match the patterns in the admin_body and admin_headers settings
will be sent to the moderators for review.  These two settings
are used to keep commands, such as "remove" or "unsubscribe", from
being posted to a mailing list.

If the administrivia setting is set to "no", the admin_body and
admin_headers settings will have no effect.
