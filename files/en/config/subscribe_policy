One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
'+confirm'.  Open allows people to subscribe themselves to the list,
but attempts to subscribe addresses diferent than where the request is
coming from will require approval.  Auto allows anybody to subscribe
anybody to the list without maintainer approval.  Closed requires
maintainer approval for all subscribe requests to the list.  Adding
'+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send a reply
back to the subscriber which includes a authentication number which
must be sent back in with another subscribe command.
