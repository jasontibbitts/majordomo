The archive_access configuration setting is used to restrict access 
to the archive command.  

The following five values are supported:

  open          -  Anyone can use the archive command.

  open+password -  Anyone registered at this domain can use the archive
                   command if a personal password is supplied.

  list          -  Anyone subscribed to a mailing list can use the
                   archive command for that list.

  list+password -  Anyone subscribed to a mailing list can use the
                   archive command for that list if a personal password 
                   is supplied.

  closed        -  Only the list administrators can use the archive command.

This setting can be overridden by rules for the archive command in the 
access_rules configuration setting.
