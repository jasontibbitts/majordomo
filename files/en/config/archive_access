The archive_access setting determines who is able to use the archive
command.  The setting has five possible values: 
  open, open+password, list, list+password, and closed.  

Open allows anyone access to the archive command.  

Open+password allows anyone registered at this domain access
if they use their personal password.

List allows only list members access. 

List+password allows list members to issue this command, but only
if they use their personal password.

Closed disables the archive command for everyone but the list
administrators.  

Some command modes (archive-sync, archive-delete) are only available to
administrators, regardless of the value of this setting.
