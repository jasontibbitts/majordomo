One of five values: open, open+password, list, list+password, closed.  

Open allows anyone access to the archive command.  

Open+password allows anyone registered at this domain access
if they use their personal password.

List allows only list members access. 

List+password allows list members to issue this command, but only
if they use their personal password.

Closed disables the archive command for everyone but the list administrators. 
Note that some command modes (archive-sync, archive-delete) are only
available to administrators, regardless of this setting.
