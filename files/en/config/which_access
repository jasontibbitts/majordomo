One of five values: open, open+password, list, list+password, closed.  

Open allows anyone access to the which command.  

Open+password allows anyone registered at this domain access
if they use their personal password.

List allows only list members access. 

List+password allows list members to issue this command, but only
if they use their personal password.

Closed disables the command for everyone but the list administrators. 

Because the which command pertains to every mailing list, disabling
the command simply means that no addresses from a particular list
will be displayed.
