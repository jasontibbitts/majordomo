The archive_date setting determines which date is used when posted
messages are stored in the archive.  There are two possibilities,
"arrival" for the date of arrival, and "delivery" for the date of
delivery.  These two dates will differ if a message is moderated, and
the moderators approve it a day or more after it arrives.
