The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) at which public list archives may be found.
If the archives are available through some means other than the Majordomo
server, such as a WWW page or FTP directory, this setting should be changed
to reflect that location.

This location is displayed by the lists-full command.  It may also be used
in the message_headers configuration setting (see "help message_headers"
and "help configset_variables" for details.)
