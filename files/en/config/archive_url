The archive_url setting should contain the uniform resource locator
(URL) at which public list archives may be found.  If the archives are
available through some means other than the Majordomo server, such as a
WWW page or FTP directory, this setting should be changed to reflect
that location.

This location is displayed by the lists-full command.  It may also be 
used in the message_headers configuration setting (see 
"help message_headers" and "help variables" for details.)
