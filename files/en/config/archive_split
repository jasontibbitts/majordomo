A word describing how the archive files should be split.  Here are the
possibilities, along with sample names of the archive files:

  yearly    - LISTNAME.1999
  quarterly - LISTNAME.19993
  monthly   - LISTNAME.200003
  weekly    - LISTNAME.2002102
  daily     - LISTNAME.20011101

Also note that changing this variable will only determine in which
archive file new messages will be stored.  Old archives will not be
renamed or altered in any way.
