A word describing how the archive files should be split.  Here are the
possibilities, along with sample names of the archive files:

  yearly  - 1999.00
  monthly - 199903.00
  weekly  - 20021031.00
  daily   - 21121002.00

Note that archives will be further split by size; see the archive_size
variable.  This gives rise to the two trailing digits, which may not be
present depending on the archive_size setting.

Also note that changing this variable will only change the settings for new
messages; old archives will not be renamed or altered in any way.
