The chunksize setting limits the amount of memory that is used for
potentially large actions.  For example, a value of 100 would cause the
who command to process addresses in blocks of 100.  Larger values will
cause the software to run slightly faster and use more memory; smaller
values will cause the software to run more slowly and use less memory.
