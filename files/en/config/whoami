What address do users send requests to? This is the full address
of the Majordomo server (for the GLOBAL pseudo-list) or the address
to which subscribers send posts (for a regular email list). If you
do not specify "whoami_owner", the string "-owner" will be appended
to the value of "whoami" from the appropriate list.
