The archive_dir setting contains the full path of the directory in which
archives of posted messages are kept.

If this setting is empty, Majordomo will store messages in the
"/public/archive" directory in the file space of the mailing list, if
that directory exists.  If the directory does not exist, messages will
not be archived, and message digests will not be delivered.
