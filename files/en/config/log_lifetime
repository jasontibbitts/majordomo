The log_lifetime setting contains the number of days that Majordomo log
entries will be kept.  Majordomo records at least one line in the log
for each command, posted message, or other request that it receives.  If
a request affects more than one address (for example, if several
addresses are subscribed to a mailing list with one command), one line
is recorded for each address.
