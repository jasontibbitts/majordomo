The number of days that Majordomo log entries will be kept.  
Majordomo logs at least one entry for each request that
it receives.  If a request affects more than one address
(for example, if several addresses are subscribed to a mailing
list with one command), one entry is logged for each address.

The information in the log is made available through the 
report command.  The log can occupy significant space on an 
active server, and slow down the report command, so entries
older than this many days are purged by the daily trigger.
