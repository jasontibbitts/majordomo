You have recently rejected token $TOKEN from $MJ.

Because rejected tokens can be the result of attempted forgery or
mailbombing, this message is being sent to inform you of everything that is
known about the transaction which caused the token to be generated in the
first place.  If you initiated the request you can probably ignore this
notice.  If you did not initiate the original request then the information
below may be of use to you or your system administrator in tracking the
source of the problem.

This information is also being sent to responsible parties at
$SITE.
