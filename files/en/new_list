                      Majordomo Guide for new list owners

The $LIST mailing list has been created at
   $SITE
and you ($USER) have been named the list owner.

The password for the $LIST list is $PASSWORD.

This guide explains how to configure a new Majordomo 2 mailing list.
Please read it carefully, and save it for future reference.

                                   Addresses

These are several mail addresses connected with your mailing list.

  $WHOAMI
The list address.  Messages sent to this address will be distributed
to all of the subscribers.

  $MJ
The server address.  Send all administrative commands to this address.
Always put commands in the body of the message, not in the subject header.

  $OWNER
The list owner address.  The subscribers can contact you by sending
mail to this address.

  $MJOWNER
The site administrator address.  Send mail to this address if you
have questions about being a list owner.

                                The help system

A wealth of information about Majordomo 2 is available through the
help pages.  To learn more, write to $MJ, 
and in the body of the message put these commands:

  help admin
  help topics

                                   Passwords

Majordomo supports two kinds of password:  administrative passwords
and personal passwords.  Your administrative password is necessary
to change the configuration of your list or to perform other maintenance
tasks.  Personal passwords are used to change personal settings.

There are two ways to use a password.  The first is to 
use the default command to tell Majordomo to apply the password
to each succeeding command.  In the following commands:

  default password $PASSWORD
  subscribe $LIST someone@example.com

Majordomo will apply the password in the first command to the 
second command.

The second way is to preface each command with the approve command
For example,

  approve $PASSWORD subscribe $LIST someone@example.com

would have the same effect as the two commands in the previous paragraph.


                             Configuration settings

Majordomo has many configuration settings which control the 
behavior of your mailing list.  These settings can be seen using
the configshow command, and changed using the configset command.

There are two configuration changes that need to be made for every new list.
The first is to use the newinfo command to customize the welcome message. 

First, check the existing info file with the command

info $LIST

If you want to change the file, use the command

newinfo $LIST <<AEIOU
  Put the text of the welcome message here.
AEIOU

The text that appears between the "newinfo" line and the final AEIOU
will be attached to the message that people receive when they subscribe
to your mailing list.

The second step is to configure digests.  Check the existing digest
settings with the command

configshow $LIST digests

If you want to change the settings, use the commands

help configset
help configset digests

to learn more about the configset command and the digest settings.


If you need help setting up your list, write to 
$MJOWNER.
