Your password at $SITE is

$PASSWORD

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list,
send the following command in email to
$REQUEST:

approve $PASSWORD unsubscribe $USER

Note that this works even if your address changes; for that reason (among
others) it is important that you have this message handy when it comes time
for you to leave the the list.

If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list,
(if you have trouble unsubscribing or have questions about the
list itself) send email to $OWNER.
This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need
to contact a human.
