Welcome to the $LIST mailing list!
Your password at $SITE is

$PASSWORD

Please save this message for future reference.  Thank you.

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list, send the
following command in email to $MJ:

approve $PASSWORD unsubscribe $LIST $USER

Note that this works even if your address changes; for that reason
(among others) it is important that you have this message handy when it
comes time for you to leave the list.

If you ever need to get in contact with the owner of the list, (if you
have trouble unsubscribing or have questions about the list itself) send
email to $OWNER.
This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need to contact
a human being.
