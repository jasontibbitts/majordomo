NOTE: these transforms must give the same result when applied multiple
times in succession.

A list of transformations to be applied to addresses before comparing
them for equivalency.  This can be used to remove the '+mailbox' part
of an address, or to remove the machine name from addresses in a
domain, or even to make all addresses fully case insensitive (which
is technically a violation of the spec for addresses, but most domains
do choose to be case insensitive).  Transforms should listed one per
line, and should be in the form /pattern/replacement/. 

To remove the "+mailbox" specifier from an address:
  /(.*?)\+.*(\@.*)/$1$2/

To make all addresses case insensitive (for purposes of subscribe,
unsubscribe, access_rules, etc):
  /(.*)/\L$1/
