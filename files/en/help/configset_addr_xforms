The transformations will not take full effect until the "rekey" command
is run.  See "help rekey" for more details.

For ease of use, seven transformations are supported that have
specific names.  To use one of these transformations, include its
name in the list, as illustrated in the previous example.

  flatten domain - keep only specified portion of domain name
  ignore case    - ignore case in the local parts (user names) of addresses
  map domain     - replace specified portion of domain name with another string
  mungedomain    - identical to "two level" (see below)
  three level    - strips all but the first 3 domain levels from addresses
  trim mbox      - removes the +mailbox from the local part of all addresses
  two level      - strips all but the first 2 domain levels from addresses

More details about each transformation appear in the following sections.

All other transformations take the form:
  /PATTERN1/REPLACEMENT/
Portions of addresses matching PATTERN1 will be replaced by the text
of REPLACEMENT.  (See "help patterns" for an introduction to patterns.)
For example, the following transformation:
  /example\.net/example.org/
would cause the following two e-mail addresses to be considered
equivalent:
  fred@example.net
  fred@example.org

It is possible, with a poor choice of transformations, to lose data from
a subscriber or registry database.  If two addresses which are
subscribed to a mailing list become equivalent after the
transformations, one of the addresses may be removed silently from the
subscriber database.


                      Seven Named Transformations

1. flatten domain XXX - keeps only specified portion (XXX) of domain name

EXAMPLE: tibbs@w.x.y.a.b.c => tibbs@a.b.c (for 'flatten domain a.b.c')

This special string requires you to specify the part of the domain
name you want to keep, the rest of the domain will be discarded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. ignore case - ignores case in local (left-hand) parts of all addresses

EXAMPLE: TiBbS@math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

To make all addresses case insensitive (for purposes of subscribe,
unsubscribe, access_rules, etc):
   /(.*)/\L$1/
or just use the special string
   ignore case

The user portion of an address (left of the '@') is not usually case
sensitive, though on some systems it is.  By default Majordomo pays
attention to case when comparing addresses in order to follow all
relevant standards and be completely safe when faced with the innumerable
number of addresses it must deal with, but this may be surprising to
those who expect the opposite behavior. Domain names (right of the '@')
are never case sensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. map domain XXX to YYY - replaces specified portion of domain name with another string

EXAMPLE:  tibbs@z.a.b.c => tibbs@z.d.e.f (for 'map a.b.c to d.e.f')

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. mungedomain - this transformation is provided for backward
   compatibility with Majordomo version 1.  It is otherwise identical
   to the "two level" transformation.

EXAMPLE: tibbs@karazm.math.uh.edu => tibbs@uh.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. three level - strips all but the first 3 domain levels from addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs@a.b.c.math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. trim mbox - removes the +mailbox from the local part of all addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs+blah@math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

To remove the "+mailbox" specifier from an address, changing from
"joe+remote@xyz.com" to just "joe@xyz.com":
   /(.*?)\+.*(\@.*)/$1$2/
or just use the special string
   trim mbox

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. two level - strips all but the first 2 domain levels from addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs@karazm.math.uh.edu => tibbs@uh.edu

To strip useless domain levels from an address at a single domain,
making "jane@mail.xyz.com" equivalent to "jane@xyz.com":
   /\@.+\.xyz.com$/\@xyz.com/i
or to take the same action for ALL domains, just use the special string
   two level
which is the same as the special string
   mungedomain

------------------------------------------------------------------------
