A list of transformations to be applied to ALL addresses before comparing
them for equivalency or storing them in the internal database. This can
be used to remove the '+mailbox' part of an address, or to remove the
machine name from addresses in a domain, or even to make all addresses
fully case insensitive. Transforms should listed one per line, and should
be in the form /pattern/replacement/ unless a special string is used. 

NOTE: These transforms must continue to give the same result when applied
to the same email address multiple times in succession.

WARNING: Be _very careful_ with this command.  It is possible, with a bad
setting of addr_xforms, to severely damage your address database.  If there
were addresses on any list (or registered) that were different but are now
the same, the duplicate entries will be silently dropped.  It is generally
possible to get them back by removing the bad setting from addr_xforms
and issuing a "rekey" command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of complicated regular expressions (see "help patterns") you
can use some special strings, one string per line. Here is a summary,
details and examples are below:

1. flatten domain - keeps only specified portion of domain name
2. ignore case    - ignores case in local (left-hand) parts of all addresses
3. map domain     - replaces specified portion of domain name with another string
4. mungedomain    - like Mj1, same as "two level" in Mj2 (see below)
5. three level    - strips all but the first 3 domain levels from addresses
6. trim mbox      - removes the +mailbox from the local part of all addresses
7. two level      - strips all but the first 2 domain levels from addresses

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. flatten domain XXX - keeps only specified portion (XXX) of domain name

EXAMPLE: tibbs@w.x.y.a.b.c => tibbs@a.b.c (for 'flatten domain a.b.c')

This special string requires you to specify the part of the domain
name you want to keep, the rest of the domain will be discarded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. ignore case - ignores case in local (left-hand) parts of all addresses

EXAMPLE: TiBbS@math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

To make all addresses case insensitive (for purposes of subscribe,
unsubscribe, access_rules, etc):
   /(.*)/\L$1/
or just use the special string
   ignore case

The user portion of an address (left of the '@') is not usually case
sensitive, though on some systems it is.  By default Majordomo pays
attention to case when comparing addresses in order to follow all
relevant standards and be completely safe when faced with the innumerable
number of addresses it must deal with, but this may be surprising to
those who expect the opposite behavior. Domain names (right of the '@')
are never case sensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. map domain XXX to YYY - replaces specified portion of domain name with another string

EXAMPLE:  tibbs@z.a.b.c => tibbs@z.d.e.f (for 'map a.b.c to d.e.f')

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. mungedomain - like Mj1, same as "two level" in Mj2 (see below)

EXAMPLE: tibbs@karazm.math.uh.edu => tibbs@uh.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. three level - strips all but the first 3 domain levels from addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs@a.b.c.math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. trim mbox - removes the +mailbox from the local part of all addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs+blah@math.uh.edu => tibbs@math.uh.edu

To remove the "+mailbox" specifier from an address, changing from
"joe+remote@xyz.com" to just "joe@xyz.com":
   /(.*?)\+.*(\@.*)/$1$2/
or just use the special string
   trim mbox

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. two level - strips all but the first 2 domain levels from addresses

EXAMPLE: tibbs@karazm.math.uh.edu => tibbs@uh.edu

To strip useless domain levels from an address at a single domain,
making "jane@mail.xyz.com" equivalent to "jane@xyz.com":
   /\@.+\.xyz.com$/\@xyz.com/i
or to take the same action for ALL domains, just use the special string
   two level
which is the same as the special string
   mungedomain
