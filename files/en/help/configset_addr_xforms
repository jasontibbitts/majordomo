A list of transformations to be applied to ALL addresses before comparing
them for equivalency or storing them in the internal database. This can
be used to remove the '+mailbox' part of an address, or to remove the
machine name from addresses in a domain, or even to make all addresses
fully case insensitive. Transforms should listed one per line, and should
be in the form /pattern/replacement/ unless a special string is used. 

NOTE: These transforms must continue to give the same result when applied
to the same email address multiple times in succession.

Instead of complicated regular expressions (see "help patterns"), you
can use the following strings, one string per line:
  ignore case - ignore case in local parts of all addresses
  mungedomain - like Mj1, same as "two level" in Mj2
  two level   - strips all but the first 2 domain levels from addresses
  three level - strips all but the first 3 domain levels from addresses
  trim mbox   - removes the +mailbox from the local part of all addresses


To make all addresses case insensitive (for purposes of subscribe,
unsubscribe, access_rules, etc):
   /(.*)/\L$1/
or just use the special string
   ignore case
The user portion of an address is not usually case sensitive, though on
some systems it is.  By default Majordomo pays attention to case when
comparing addresses in order to follow all relevant standards and be
completely safe when faced with the innumerable number of addresses it
must deal with, but this may be surprising to those who expect the
opposite behavior. Domain names are never case sensitive.

Tostrip useless domain levels from an address at a single domain,
making "jane@mail.xyz.com" equivalent to "jane@xyz.com":
   /\@.+\.xyz.com$/\@xyz.com/i
or to take the same action for ALL domains, just use the special string
   two level

To remove the "+mailbox" specifier from an address, changing from
"joe+remote@xyz.com" to just "joe@xyz.com":
   /(.*?)\+.*(\@.*)/$1$2/
or just use the special string
   trim mbox
