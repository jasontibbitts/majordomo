A list of transformations to be applied to addresses before comparing
them for equivalency.  This can be used to remove the '+mailbox' part
of an address, or to remove the machine name from addresses in a
domain.  Transforms should listed one per line, and should be in the
form /pattern/replacement/.  For example, /(.*?)\+.*(\@.*)/$1$2/
removes the '+mailbox' specifier from an address.  NOTE: these
transforms must give the same result when applied multiple times in
succession.
