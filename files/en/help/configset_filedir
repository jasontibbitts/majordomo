EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL filedir =

(text above is from configshow, Mj2 0.1199902200, extracted 12 Apr 1999)


The directory where the filespace for the list is kept.
If you leave this variable undefined (e.g. nothing after the "="),
the "put" command will create files inside "listname/files/public"
by default, and inside "listname/files" if you start the put path
with a slash. See "help put" for details.

If you define this variable, you must make sure that Majordomo has
permission to access the directory and the files in it. Defining
"filedir" may affect many commands like "get", "put", "index", and
even "help" if you have stored files in the GLOBAL pseudo-list.
