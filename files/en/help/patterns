Majordomo Patterns
==================

The Short Story
---------------

Where you can use a pattern, use something like:

  "user@example.com"
  "example.com"i

where the trailing 'i' specifies case insensitivity.

If you need more complicated matching, you can use:

  %user@*example.com%i

where an asterisk matches any number of any character.

If you need more powerful patterns, you can use a Perl regular expression
surrounded by '/':

  /(someone|nobody)\@.*example.com/i


The Details
-----------

Majordomo is written in Perl and exposes the power of the Perl pattern
matching language to the user.  Unfortunately, Perl regular expressions
(regexps for short) are somewhat complicated and difficult to learn.  They
also have their own quirks which can get in the way of doing simple pattern
matching tasks.

To eliminate some of the complexity, Majordomo provides two simpler forms
of pattern matching in addition to full Perl regular expressions.

A Majordomo pattern is composed of enclosing delimiters, modifiers, and the
pattern itself.  Majordomo uses the delimiters to determine the type of the
pattern.  The modifiers change the behavior of the pattern; generally, the
only useful modifier makes the match insensitive to case.  There are three
supported types of pattern:

  substring
  shell-like
  Perl-like regular expressions

They differ in their delimiters and the number and function of various
special characters (the so called metacharacters).


Substring Patterns
==================

  Examples: "example.com"
            "user@somewhere.example.com"i

The delimiter is a double quote.  There are no special characters; the
pattern matches if the given string occurs anywhere within the string to be
matched.  A trailing 'i' specifies that the match is done insensitive to
case.


Shell-Like Patterns
===================

  Examples: %user@*example.com%i
            %u-???@*example.com%i

The delimiter is a percent sign.  These patterns are reminicent of csh or
DOS patterns in that a question mark matches any single character and an
asterisk matches any number (including zero) of any character.  Character
classes with '[' and ']' are also supported.


Perl-Like Regular Expressions
=============================

More extreme power is available by using the regular expression language
available through Perl.  These patterns are called 'Perl-like' because
there is one important difference between them and real Perl regexps: in
Perl version 5 and above, unescaped '@' symbols are not allowed in
patterns.  This is a constant source of problems for Majordomo users
because '@' signs are obviously very common in Internet mail addresses.

To ease this difficulty, Majordomo checks the syntax of user-supplied
regexps and if they have syntax errors relating to unescaped '@' symbols,
they are all escaped and the pattern is checked again.  This solves the
bulk of the problems.  Be careful, though, when writing Perl code; the
enhanced Majordomo regexps will only provide you with syntax errors.

What follows is a basic discussion of Perl regular expressions.  All '@'
symbols will be shown escaped for correctness.  For more information,
consult the Perl documentation or any reasonable book on Perl.


Perl Regexps in Depth
=====================

A regular expression is a concise way of expressing a pattern
in a series of characters.  The full power of regular expressions can
make some difficult tasks quite easy, but we will only brush the
surface here.

The character / is used to mark the beginning and end of a regular
expression.  Letters and numbers stand for themselves.  Many of the
other characters are symbolic.  Some commonly used ones are:

  \@    the `@' found in nearly all addresses; it must be preceeded by a
        backslash to avoid errors in Perl
  .     (period) any character
  *     previous character, zero or more times; note especially...
  .*    any character, zero or more times
  +     previous character, one or more times; so for example...
  a+    letter "a", one or more times
  \     next character stands for itself; so for example...
  \.     literally a period, not meaning "any character"
  ^     beginning of the string; so for example...
  ^a    a string beginning with letter "a"
  $     end of the string; so for example...
  a$    a string ending with letter "a"


Example 1
---------

     /foo\.example\.com/

Notice that the periods are preceded by a backslash so that they are
interpreted as periods, rather than wildcards.  This matches any string
containing:

     foo.example.com

such as:

     foo.example.com
     bar.foo.example.com
     user@bar.foo.example.com
     users%bar.foo.example.com@example.com


Example 2
---------

     /johndoe\@.*foo\.example\.com/

The `@' has special meaning to Perl and should be prefixed with a backslash
to avoid errors.  The string ".*" means "any character, zero or more
times".  So this matches:

     johndoe@foo.example.com
     johndoe@terminus.foo.example.com
     ajohndoe@terminus.foo.example.com@example.com

But it doesn't match:

     johndoe@example.com
     brent@foo.example.com


Example 3
---------

     /^johndoe\@.*cs\.example\.org$/

This is similar to Example 2, and matches the same first two strings:

     johndoe@foo.example.org
     johndoe@terminus.foo.example.org

But it doesn't match:

     ajohndoe@terminus.foo.example.org@example.com

...because the regular expression says the string has to begin with
letter "j" and end with letter "g", by using the ^ and $ symbols, and
neither of those is true for ajohndoe@terminus.foo.example.org@example.com.


Example 4
---------

     /.*/

This is the regular expression that matches anything.


Example 5
---------

     /.\*johndoe/

Here the * is preceded by a \, so it refers literally to an asterisk
character and not the symbolic meaning "zero or more times".  The . still
has its symbolic meaning of "any one character", so it would match:

     a*johndoe
     s*johndoe

Because the . by itself implies one character, it would not match:

     *johndoe


Example 6
---------

Normally all matches are case sensitive; you can make any match case
insensitive by appending an `i' to the end of the expression.

     /example\.com/i

This would match example.com, EXAMPLE.com, ExAmPlE.cOm, etc.  Removing the `i':

     /example\.com/

...would match example.com but not EXAMPLE.com or any other capitalization.


To be on the safe side put a \ in front of any characters in the
regular expressions that are not numbers or letters.  In order to put
a / into the regular expression, the same rule holds: precede it
with a \.  Thus, with \ in front of the / and = characters, this:

     /\/CO\=US/

...matches /CO=US and may be a useful regular expression to those of you
who need to deal with X.400 addresses that contain / characters.


Example 7
---------

Normally, all whitespace within a pattern is matched verbatim, but it is
sometimes desirable to add some additional space within a pattern to make
it more readable.  For instance, here is a pattern matching some common
quoting characters in email:

  /^(-|:|>|[a-z]+>)/i

This can be a bit difficult to follow, so we can space it out a bit:

  /^( - | : | > | [a-z]+> )/xi

The 'x' modifier specifies that whitespace is to be ignored, and makes the
pattern a bit easier to read.  If you want to match actual whitespace, use
'\s'.

Note that the 'x' modifier provides additional functionality to Perl code
relating to comments, but because Majordomo requires patterns to lie all on
a single line, this is not significant here.
