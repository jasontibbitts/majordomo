If this is true, addresses are required to have fully qualified domain
names.  Since Majordomo does not verify this using name service lookups,
this essentially means that the right hand side of an address must contain
at least one period.

To enable Majordomo to run at a site where the mail transfer agents do not
fully qualify the domain names, set this to false.
