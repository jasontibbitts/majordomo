EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL addr_require_fqdn = 1


If this is true, addresses are required to have fully qualified domain
names, often referred to as "strict addressing".  Since Majordomo does
not verify this using name service lookups, this essentially means that
an address must contain '@' and the string on the right hand side of
'@' (the domain) must contain at least one period.

To enable Majordomo to run at a site where the mail transfer agents do not
fully qualify the domain names, set this to false.
