The showtokens command displays a list of token identifiers (or
"tokens") for Majordomo commands and posted messages that are awaiting
someone's approval.  A token is a 12-digit number (for example,
"0B18-996F-76ED") that uniquely identifies one command or posted
message.

There are six kinds of token:  confirm, consult, delay, async, probe, 
and alias.

Confirm tokens are awaiting approval by the person whom the request
affects.

Consult tokens are awaiting approval by one or more of a mailing list's
owners or moderators.

Delay tokens are automatically approved after a certain amount
of time.  Delay tokens are only displayed if the "delay" command mode
is used.

Async tokens are used to speed Majordomo's response to an "accept"
command.  Instead of completing the request immediately, Majordomo
will convert a consult token for a posted message into an async
token.  This makes moderation using the web interfaces much
faster, because Majordomo does not have to wait for a posted message
to be queued for delivery before sending a response to the moderator
who approved the message.  Async tokens are only displayed if the
"async" command mode is used.

Alias tokens refer to other tokens.  They are used when the approval
of more than one person is required.  If the same token identifier 
was sent in a confirmation message to several moderators, there is a
risk that an untrustworthy moderator could approve the same message
more than once.  Sending a separate, alias token to each moderator
avoids this problem.  Alias tokens are only displayed if the
"alias" command mode is used.

Probe tokens are created when a delivery failure ("bounce") occurs and
the bounce_rules configuration setting calls for a probe message to be
sent.  A probe message is sent to the address which experienced the
failure; if the probe message cannot be delivered, the address will be
unsubscribed from the mailing list.  See "help configset_bounce_rules" 
for more details.  

Accepting a probe token will cause the probed address to be unsubscribed
from the mailing list.  Only do this if you are absolutely certain
that the probed address is invalid.  Rejecting a probe token will
prevent a bouncing address from being unsubscribed if a the probe
message cannot be delivered.

The "showtokens" command provides a list of all outstanding "confirm" and
"consult" tokens.  If there are many such unhandled tokens, it may be due
to an absent list owner or a spammer.  If one or more available mode
switches are used, only those types of tokens will be listed.

Anyone with a password that authorizes them to show the tokens can use
the "accept" or "reject" command to immediately approve or discard one
or more requests, thereby clearing the backlog.

All tokens have a "lifetime," typically one week, after which they
expire.  Confirm, consult, and async tokens vanish when they expire.
Delay tokens' requests are completed when they expire.  When alias
tokens expire, the result varies according to the token to which the
alias token refers.

Depending upon the "token_remind" setting, reminder messages
are sent if a token has not been explicitly accepted or rejected 
after a certain number of days.

The command
  showtokens ALL
can be used by site administrators to see the unfulfilled requests
for all of the mailing lists in a domain.

The tokens shown can be limited to one kind of request.  For example,
  showtokens ALL subscribe
would display every uncompleted subscription request for a domain.
