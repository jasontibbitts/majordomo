The "showtokens" command provides a list of all outstanding tokens
(e.g. pending "accept" or "reject" requests). If there are many such
unhandled tokens, it may be due to an absent list owner or a spammer.

Anyone with a password that authorizes them to show the tokens can
use the "accept" or "reject" command to send these tokens to the
server for immediate action, thereby clearing the backlog.

See Also:
   help accept     (approving  action)
   help reject     (cancelling action)
   help tokeninfo  (for more details about a particular token)
   help configset token_lifetime (site-wide or per-list expiration period)
   help configset token_remind   (site-wide or per-list reminder before expiration)
