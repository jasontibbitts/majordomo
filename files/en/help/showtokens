The "showtokens" command provides a list of all outstanding tokens
(e.g. pending "accept" or "reject" requests). If there are many such
unhandled tokens, it may be due to an absent list owner or a spammer.

Anyone with a password that authorizes them to show the tokens can
use the "accept" or "reject" command to send these tokens to the
server for immediate action, thereby clearing the backlog.

==> see also: accept (approving  action)
==> see also: reject (cancelling action)
==> see also: configset token_lifetime (site-wide or per-list expiration period)
==> see also: configset token_remind   (site-wide or per-list reminder before expiration)

For a list of topics, or this text, send one of the next two lines
   help topics
   help showtokens
to the server at $MJ
