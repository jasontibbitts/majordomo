A token is an identification number (for example, "0B18-996F-76ED")
that refers to a request that has not yet been completed.

There are three kinds of token:  confirm, consult, and delay.

Confirm tokens need to be approved by the person whom the request
affects before they can take place.

Consult tokens need to be approved by one or more of a mailing list's
owners or moderators before they can take place.

Delay tokens are automatically approved after a certain amount
of time.  Delay tokens are only displayed if the "delay" command mode
is used.

The "showtokens" command provides a list of all outstanding tokens.
If there are many such unhandled tokens, it may be due to an absent 
list owner or a spammer.

Anyone with a password that authorizes them to show the tokens can
use the "accept" or "reject" command to immediately approve or
discard one or more requests, thereby clearing the backlog.

All tokens have a "lifetime," typically one week, after which they expire.  
Confirm and consult tokens vanish when they expire.  Delay tokens'
requests are fulfilled when they expire. 

Depending upon the "token_remind" setting, reminder messages
are sent if a token has not been explicitly accepted or rejected 
after a certain number of days.

The command
  showtokens ALL
can be used by site administrators to see the unfulfilled requests
for all of the mailing lists in a domain.

The tokens shown can be limited to one kind of request.  For example,
  showtokens ALL subscribe
would display every uncompleted subscription request for a domain.
