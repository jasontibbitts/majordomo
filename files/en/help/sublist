The sublist command can be used to create, destroy, or see information
about a sublist.  Sublists are also called auxiliary lists.  See
"help auxiliary_list" for more details on their purpose.  The sublist
command usually requires an administrative password.

The sublist-create command will create a new auxiliary list.  If the
auxiliary list already exists, an error message will be displayed.

The sublist-destroy command will destroy an existing sublist and all of
its subscriptions.  If the sublist is listed in the "sublists" setting,
you must remove it from that setting first.

The plain sublist command will display information, such as the number
of subscribers and messages posted in the last month, if the sublist
exists.

A sublist can be made public by adding it to the "sublists"
configuration setting.  See "help configset_sublists" for more
information.
