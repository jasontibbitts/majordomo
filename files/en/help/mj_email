NAME
    mj_email - email interface to Majordomo

DESCRIPTION
    The Majordomo e-mail interface, mj_email, handles four different kinds
    of message:

    list
        The message is intended to be distributed to the subscribers of a
        mailing list.

    majordomo
        The message contains commands that will be processed by the
        Majordomo server.

    owner
        The message is intended to be sent to the owners or moderators of a
        mailing list.

    request
        The purpose of the message will depend upon the GLOBAL
        *request_answer* configuration setting. By default, commands in the
        message will be processed by the server.

    The mj_email command has been superseded by three programs that comprise
    the Majordomo e-mail queueing system: mj_enqueue, mj_queueserv, and
    mj_queuerun. The queueing system limits the number of programs that are
    employed in message processing at any given time. As a result, the
    queueing system responds to periods of high activity more evenly.
