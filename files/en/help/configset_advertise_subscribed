EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL advertise_subscribed = 1


If this is on, users that are subscribed to a list will always be
shown that list, regardless of any advertise restriction; the list's
advertise restrictions will not even be consulted.  This can result in
a performance increase.

If this is off, the list's advertise restrictions will be consulted
normally.  This will still result in the same behavior unless an
access_rules entry is used to override the normal processing of
advertise/noadvertise, but list owners will then have the choice.
