sessionid, required, is a unique 40-digit identifier
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This command returns session data. The sessionid is a string of exactly
40 hex digits in lower case, to get information on a previous Mj2 session.

Every "connection" to Majordomo (i.e. every email sent, mj_shell started,
etc.) is called a session.  Each session gets a unique random identifier
(a 160 bit hex number) and all available information about that session
(message headers, relevant bits from the shell environment, etc.) along
with a log of each command that was executed is stored in a file with
things like the headers or the CGI environment.  This information can
be retrieved using the sessioninfo command.

Session files are deleted after the amount of time specified in
the session_lifetime.  They are extremely useful in tracking down the source
of things like forged subscription requests and spam (particularly on a
list that strips Received: headers).  The relevant session data is also
sent out when someone rejects a confirmation token.  (The assumption is
that the request may have been forged, so everything available for
tracking the forgery is automatically sent out.)

Where do you get session IDs from? The server will mail you confirmation
messages (if configured to do so) that include lines like this:
  | was executed with status:
  |   1 (success)
  | in session:
  |   f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026fdb43ac79
  | from the shell interface.

What kind of information do you get from sessioninfo?
Here is a sample output:
  | % mj_shell sessioninfo f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026fdb43ac79
  | Stored information from session f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026fdb43ac79
  | Source: owner
  | PID:    20818
  | 
  | Received: from tibbs by example.org with local (Exim 3.13 #1)
  |         id 12YH0C-0005Md-00
  |         for test-owner@example.org; Thu, 23 Mar 2000 17:26:56 -0600

  | Message-Id: <E12YH0C-0005Md-00@malifon.math.uh.edu>

  | 1: (message to test-owner)
  | 
This output shows that a message was mailed to test-owner.  You have the
headers, the PID of the injecting process, the action that was performed
and its return status.  There are three possible values for the return
status:

  1     The command succeeded.
  0     The command failed.
 -1     The command stalled.  Commands can stall if they are
        delayed or require confirmation.  See "help delay"
        and "help configset_access_rules" for more information.

In most cases, only the e-mail headers or other basic information about
the session and command results are saved.  However, a bounce
(an error message that was mailed to Majordomo because of a delivery 
failure) is saved in its entirety.  This makes the sessioninfo command
very useful for trying to determine what caused a delivery failure
after the fact.  The report-full command can be used by list
administrators to determine the session identifier that corresponds to a
particular delivery failure (see "help report" for more details.)
