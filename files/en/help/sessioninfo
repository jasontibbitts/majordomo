sessionid, required, is a 32-digit ID from a previous server command
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This returns session data.  Every connection to the Majordomo server gets a
session and everything done in that session os recorded in a file, along
with things like the headers or the CGI environment.  Just run
  sessioninfo sessionid
where sessionid is a string of exactly 32 hex digits in lower case,
to get information on a previous Mj2 session.

Where do you get session IDs from? The server will mail you confirmation
messages (if configured to do so) that include lines like this:
  | was executed with status:
  |   1 (success)
  | in session:
  |   f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026f
  | from the shell interface.

What kind of information do you get from sessioninfo?
Here is a sample output:
  | % mj_shell sessioninfo f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026f
  | Stored information from session f88bf40a18e28ae61a2c9197919f026f
