addendum to Majordomo2 "configset ack_denials_always" File - updated 24 Feb 99

This command can be used to override a subscriber's setting of "noack".
It does not generate new messages, but it may cause messages that would
otherwise be suppressed to actually be delivered.

When a subscriber post is denied and a subscriber has used "set" to
enable the "noack" flag, the message appears to vanish and the list
owner may be challenged to debug a non-existant problem. Setting
ack_denials_always means that users will always receive something back
when they violate one of the "access_rules" or other mechanisms that
can bounce a post.

==> see also: configset access_rules  (for how to specify replyfiles)
==> see also: configset default_flags (for pre-setting the "ack" flag)
==> see also: set                     (for subscribers to set the "ack" flag)
