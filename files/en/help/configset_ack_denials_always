EXAMPLE:
configset listname ack_denials_always = 1


If this is on, users whose posts are denied will always be informed of
the denial.  Otherwise they will be informed based on their flag
settings: if they have either the 'ackall' or 'ackimportant' flag set
then they will receive notice of the denial, else they will not
recieve any type of notice.
This command can be used to override a subscriber's setting of "noack".
It does not generate new messages, but it may cause messages that would
otherwise be suppressed to actually be delivered.

When a subscriber post is denied and a subscriber has used "set" to
enable the "noack" flag, the message appears to vanish and the list
owner may be challenged to debug a non-existant problem. Setting
ack_denials_always means that users will always receive something back
when they violate one of the "access_rules" or other mechanisms that
can bounce a post.
