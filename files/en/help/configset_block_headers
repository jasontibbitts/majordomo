This setting affects messages sent to any command address, including 
the main server address ($MJ) and
any LIST-request, LIST-subscribe, or other command-related address that
is supported at this site.  See "help configset_aliases" for a
description of other addresses that will cause commands to be processed.

By default, Majordomo will add an "X-Loop: majordomo" header to all
messages sent by the server in response to commands.  The block_headers
setting contains a pattern that will match "X-Loop" headers, to prevent
mail loops between two Majordomo server addresses.  

See "help configset message_headers" for an explanation of how the "X-Loop" 
and other headers are added to e-mail messages.

By default, any match generated by the block_headers setting will cause
the message to be discarded without sending a reply to the person who
sent the message.  A notice will be mailed to the domain administrators
if they have chosen to be informed of "connect" events.  See 
"help configset_inform" for more information about these notices.

The score and variable name features of other pattern-matching settings
are also available for the block_headers setting.  For example, the 
following pattern:

  /From:.*big@example.com/ 5,example

would cause 5 to be added to the "block_example" access variable for
each header in a message that matches the pattern.  See 
"help configset_admin_body" for more examples of the score and variable
features.  If the variable name consists of all capital letters, by
default nothing will happen.

It is possible to send a reply message to the person whose message was
blocked, using the "mailfile" action in the access_rules setting.  See
"help configset_access_rules" and "help access" for more details.
