If any of the headers in a message sent to one of the list server addresses
matches one of these regular expressions, the message will be forwarded to
the list owners instead of being parsed for commands.

The server will forward any message with an "X-Loop" header (regardless of
the content of the header) that is sent to one of the server aliases to the
owner instead. Server aliases include addresses like majordomo@xxx.com,
listname-request@xxx.com, listname-subscribe@xxx.com, etc., depending on
various MTA settings and configuration choices. Trapping X-Loop prevents
a mail loop if a confirmation request has been sent to an administrative
address, because an X-Loop header is added to Confirm, Consult, and Reminder
messages (only) REGARDLESS of how "configset message_headers" is configured.
These messages are a serious problem because they contain unquoted majordomo
commands.  A new token may be created each time a message loops, so stopping
loops is critical enough to justify adding and trapping special headers.

Sympa and Smartlist both use X-Loop.  Listar uses X-listar-antiloop,
and Mailman uses X-BeenThere and List-Id headers.  Having an
Mj2-specific header would allow more definite control, but supporting
X-Loop is a step toward creating a standard, since other software uses it.
List owners are encouraged to add an X-Loop header to outgoing posts,
using "configset message_headers", as an additional safety precaution.
See "help configset message_headers" for details.
