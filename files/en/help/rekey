This regenerates the database keys.  The database keys depend on the
setting of addr_xforms, so when that variable is changed the database
must be rekeyed or some addresses may become inaccessible.

Be _very careful_ with this command.  It is possible, with a bad setting
of addr_xforms, to severely damage your address database.  If there were
addresses on any list (or registered) that were different but are now the
same, the duplicate entries will be silently dropped.  It is generally
possible to get them back by removing the bad setting from addr_xforms
and rekeying.
