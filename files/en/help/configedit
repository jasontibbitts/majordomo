The configedit command is used to display and change one or more
configuration settings for a mailing list.  This command is only
supported by the mj_shell command line program (see "help mj_shell" for
more details.)

When the configedit command is invoked, a separate editor program is
run, and the configuration settings are displayed.  By editing the
settings and saving the changes, you will cause Majordomo to execute the
configset commands to change the settings.  The editor program is chosen
from the EDITOR environment variable or the VISUAL environment variable.
If neither of those variables is set, the "vi" program is used.

Other than this special use of an external editor, the configedit
command is identical to the configshow command.  Please see 
"help configshow" for more information.

A complete list of configuration settings is included in "help topics".
