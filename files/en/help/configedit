NOTE: Implemented for shell interface only!

Retrieves the value of the variable and opens an editor on it. The editor
to use is chosen from the EDITOR environment variable. When the editor is
exited, the variable is set to the new value assuming the editor contents
have been modified and saved and assuming there are no syntax errors.

Multiple variables can be edited by listing them separated by commas, and
groups can be specified with upper case letters.  Listing no variable
name at all retrieves the complete list of variables.

Unless the '-nocomments' option is used, explanatory information about
the variable(s) will be returned as well, as with "configshow".

A complete list of variables is included in "help configset".

==> see also: configdefault (to have the variable track the default value)
==> see also: configset     (to set the variable to a non-default value)
==> see also: configshow    (to display the variable's current value)
