addendum to Majordomo2 "configset master_password" File - updated 25 Feb 99

NOTE: This command applies to LIST MASTER PASSWORDS only! These passwords
are used for configuring lists, adding and removing subscribers, etc. The
list's master_password can be used to change anything for the named list.
It also allows the review of list information with commands like "who" that
may be otherwise disabled.

Refer to "help password" for personal passwords that subscribers use.

To change a password you will need to approve the command as follows:
   approve CURRENTPASSWORD configset LISTNAME master_password = NEWPASSWORD
or, for shorter lines:
   default password CURRENTPASSWORD
   configset LISTNAME master_password = NEWPASSWORD
where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of a real list or the word
"GLOBAL" for the site, and "NEWPASSWORD" is replaced with your password.

The GLOBAL master_password for a domain works on every list in that domain
and for configuring the special GLOBAL pseudo-list. It should be reserved
for use by the site administrator in most cases. Note that a host computer
can contain several virtual domains, and the GLOBAL password is unique for
each such domain.

The SITE password (chosen by the person who installed Majordomo) can be
used to do anything to any list or any global configuration anywhere on
the system, including all virtual domains. It can only be changed from an
operating system shell, either by re-installing Majordomo or by editing
.../SITE/config.pl

See "help configset passwords" for other limited or subsidiary passwords
that can be used to delegate list management tasks without releasing the
overall list password.
