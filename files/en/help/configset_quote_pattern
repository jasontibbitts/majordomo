$INCLUDE-config/quote_pattern

Sometimes, people will "quote" an entire, earlier message in their 
replies.  Doing this makes the message much longer than necessary. 
If the conversation continues, the discussion can become difficult to
read because of the amount of quoted text from earlier messages.

The percent_quoted access variable contains the percentage of lines in
the body of the message that match the quote pattern.  The quoted_lines
access variable contains the total number of lines that match the quote
pattern.  Access variables can be used in the access_rules setting to
establish limits for quoting.  See "help access_variables" and 
"help configset_access_rules" for more details.  By default, there are
no limits for quoting.
