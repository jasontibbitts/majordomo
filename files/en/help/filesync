NOTE: As of March 2000, his command is no longer implemented because
      it is no longer needed. The documentation below may be useful
      for older versions.

The "filesync" command is used only by site administrators and very
savvy list owners, and usually only after shell-level hacking.

This updates the filespace information database.  Since Majordomo needs
to know more information about a file than is provided by the file system
(a description and the required MIME types, for instance), it keeps
additional data in a simple database.  If files are added or removed by
means other than Majordomo commands, the database must be updated with
the new information by way of this command.

Don't forget to filesync the "GLOBAL" pseudo-list if files are altered
outside the confines of a regular list.
