Where to bounces from the whoami address go?
These important help files are related:
   help configset whereami
   help configset whoami
   help configset whoami_owner

If you do not specify "whoami_owner", the string "-owner" will
be appended to the value of "whoami" from the appropriate list.


For normal lists:
  The default value of "whoami_owner" is "listname-owner" for
  the list "listname@nowhere.org". You can set "whoami_owner"
  to be any local address, WITHOUT a domain specified, and the
  "whereami" domain will be added.

  As indicated in the configshow comments, bounces from the list
  will be sent to the list owner. These addresses are common:
     listname@nowhere.org         (the list itself, "whoami@whereami")
     listname-owner@nowhere.org   (the human running the list)


For the GLOBAL pseudo-list:
  You should set "whoami_owner" to be "majordomo-owner" WITHOUT
  a domain specified. The value of "configset whereami" will be
  supplied as the domain. 

  As indicated in the configshow comments, failed subscribe
  commands and other actions which are not specific to a list
  but which bounce or generate errors will go to this address.
  For example, these are common addresses:
     majordomo@nowhere.org        (the server, "whoami")
     majordomo-owner@nowhere.org  (the human running the server)

  WARNING:  If you fail to specify "whoami_owner" after supplying
  a full email address (including domain) for "whoami", commands
  like "lists" to die horribly due to a malformed email address.
