EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL whoami_owner = admin@example.org

$INCLUDE-config/whoami_owner

For example, to contact the administrators of a mailing list with the
address "chard@example.com", it would be necessary to write to the
address "chard-owner@example.com".  By default the whoami_owner and
sender configuration settings have the same value; however, the
whoami_owner setting is displayed publicly, whereas the address in the
sender configuration is only used internally.  This address frequently
appears in the "From:" header of e-mail notices that are sent by the
Majordomo server in response to a command or posted message.

If there is no domain given in the address, for example:
  configset mylist whoami_owner = webmaster
the domain in the GLOBAL whereami configuration setting is used.  If the
domain is example.com, the "webmaster" sender address would become
"webmaster@example.com" in this instance.

This setting should not be set to the address of the list, or mail loops
may occur.
