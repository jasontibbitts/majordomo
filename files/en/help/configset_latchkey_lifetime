$INCLUDE-config/latchkey_lifetime

Old latchkeys are removed from the latchkey database by the "token"
trigger in the GLOBAL triggers configuration setting.  By default, this
happens daily.

The latchkey database is kept in the "_latchkeys.D" or "_latchkeys.T"
file in the main directory for the GLOBAL pseudo-list.

A latchkey like a confirmation token, is composed of  12 hexadecimal
digits, separated into three groups by hyphens, for example:

  B34F-78A1-9023

See "help admin_moderate" for more information about tokens.
