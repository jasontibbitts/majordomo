This file describes the general format that Majordomo uses for specifying
the time at which an event happens. For list configurations that need
a time specification, you can use any of the following forms:

1. HOUR: an integer from 0 to 23
   - 0 is midnight, 12 is noon
   - the action will be taken only during this hour of each day
      (at whatever minute is convenient for the software)

2. HOUR RANGE: two integers separated by a dash
   - the action will be taken anytime between these two hours each day
   - if the second number is less than the first, the range continues
      into the next day (wraps around midnight)

3. HOUR LIST: two or more integers separated by commas (and perhaps dashes)
   - the action will be taken during each of these hours each day, as needed
   - can be combined with HOUR RANGE: 6,18 and 6,15-20 are both valid
      (for example, 6,12-14 would act every day at 6am, noon, 1pm, and 2pm.)

4. WEEK DAY: the name or number representing a day of the week
   - the action will be taken anytime during that day
      (early in the day unless an HOUR spec is also used)
   - can use standard English day names: Monday, Tuesday, etc
   - can use unique portion of standard day names: mon, tue, etc
   - can use a number followed by 'w': 1w for sun, 2w for mon, 3w for tue, etc.
   - can use "daily":  the same as "sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat" (see below)
   - can use "weekly": the same as "sun" (see below)

5. MONTH DAY: the name or number representing a day of the month
   - the action will be taken anytime during that day
      (early in the day unless an HOUR spec is also used)
   - can use ordinals: 1st, 2nd, 26th, etc
   - can use a number followed by 'm': 1m for 1st, 2m for 2nd, 3m for 3rd, etc.
   - can use "monthly": the same as "1st" (see below)

6. HOUR OF DAY: combines day and hour specs (separately described above)
   - WEEK DAY or MONTH DAY is followed by HOUR or HOUR RANGE or HOUR LIST in parentheses
   - a spec like fri(6) or 6w(6) limits the action to a specific hour of a specific day
   - a spec like fri(6,18) limits the action to several specific hours of a specific day
   - a spec like 22nd(12-18) limits the action to a range of hours on a specific day

7. SPECIAL NAMES: these can be used as alternatives to the DAY specs above
   - always:    take the action whenever possible (cron usually runs triggers hourly)
   - anytime:   same as 'always'
   - never:     never take this action even if the opportunity arises
   - none:      same as 'never'
   - daily:     the action is taken early every morning.
   - weekly:    the action is taken every Sunday.
   - monthly:   the action is taken on the first of every month.
   - quarterly: the action is taken on the first day of each quarter
                     (the first of January, April, July, and October)
   - yearly:    the action is taken on every first of January.


NOTE: Commas can be used to make lists of hours or days, so you
      can have: mo(6,8,10), tu(12-18,22-6), we, 3rd(4,10-14)
