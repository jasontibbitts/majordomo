This file contains information for both subscribers and administrators,
but subscribers will probably find only the first section useful!

Below are several general formats that Majordomo uses for specifying
the time at which an event happens, how long to wait for something to
happen, when it did happen, etc.

Section 1 - Time Periods (for 'set nomail', 'default delay', etc)
Section 2 - Time Stamps (for 'archive-get', 'report', etc)
Section 3 - Time Specs (for administrators and list configuration)

Section 1 - Time Periods (for 'set nomail', 'default delay', etc)

The period of time before something happens can be specified in
hours, days, weeks, months, or years. For example, use:
   3h for 3 hours
   7d for 7 days
   2w for 2 weeks
   6m for 6 months
   2y for 2 years

The single-letter abbreviations h/d/w/m/y can be expanded into full
words if you want: only one character is required, but the words shown
above (hours, days, weeks, months, years) are equivalent. If you are
using full words, remember NOT to use a space: "2weeks", NOT "2 weeks".

If you need more flexibility in specifying time spans, you
can combine these, as in 2w3d for two weeks and three days.

If no character follows the number, different portions of the software
make different decisions: For example, the delay command interprets
unqualified numbers as seconds out of a minute, and the post_limits
configuration setting interprets them as number of posts. Be careful
to check the help file for any command on which you don't include
a qualifier like "d".

Section 2 - Time Stamps (for 'archive-get', 'report', etc)

To include an entire year, use a four-digit number. For example:
   1999      for the year  of           1999

To include only one month of a specific year, use a four-digit year
plus a two-digit month (with a leading '0' if needed):
   200007    for the month of    July   2000

To include a specific WEEK use a four-digit year, plus a two-digit
month (with a leading '0' if needed), plus a ONE-DIGIT week:
   2000011  for the first week of January 2000

To include a specific DAY use a four-digit year, plus a two-digit
month (with a leading '0' if needed), plus a TWO-DIGIT day:
   20000802 for the day   of 02 August 2000

NOTE: There is a subtle difference between day and week time stamps...
days are always two digits, weeks are always one digit!

Section 3 - Time Specs (for administrators and list configuration)

For list configurations that need a time specification, you can use any
of the following forms:

1. HOUR: an integer from 0 to 23
   - 0 is midnight, 12 is noon
   - the action will be taken only during this hour of each day
      (at whatever minute is convenient for the software)

2. HOUR RANGE: two integers separated by a dash
   - the action will be taken anytime between these two hours each day
   - if the second number is less than the first, the range continues
      into the next day (wraps around midnight)

3. HOUR LIST: two or more integers separated by commas (and perhaps dashes)
   - the action will be taken during each of these hours each day, as needed
   - can be combined with HOUR RANGE: 6,18 and 6,15-20 are both valid
      (for example, 6,12-14 would act every day at 6am, noon, 1pm, and 2pm.)

4. WEEK DAY: the name or number representing a day of the week
   - the action will be taken anytime during that day
      (early in the day unless an HOUR spec is also used)
   - can use standard English day names: Monday, Tuesday, etc
   - can use unique portion of standard day names: mon, tue, etc
   - can use a number followed by 'w': 1w for sun, 2w for mon, 3w for tue, etc.
   - can use "daily":  the same as "sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat" (see below)
   - can use "weekly": the same as "sun" (see below)

5. MONTH DAY: the name or number representing a day of the month
   - the action will be taken anytime during that day
      (early in the day unless an HOUR spec is also used)
   - can use ordinals: 1st, 2nd, 26th, etc
   - can use a number followed by 'm': 1m for 1st, 2m for 2nd, 3m for 3rd, etc.
   - can use "monthly": the same as "1st" (see below)

6. HOUR OF DAY: combines day and hour specs (separately described above)
   - WEEK DAY or MONTH DAY is followed by HOUR or HOUR RANGE or HOUR LIST in parentheses
   - a spec like fri(6) or 6w(6) limits the action to a specific hour of a specific day
   - a spec like fri(6,18) limits the action to several specific hours of a specific day
   - a spec like 22nd(12-18) limits the action to a range of hours on a specific day

7. SPECIAL NAMES: these can be used as alternatives to the DAY specs above
   - always:    take the action whenever possible (cron usually runs triggers hourly)
   - anytime:   same as 'always'
   - never:     never take this action even if the opportunity arises
   - none:      same as 'never'
   - daily:     the action is taken early every morning.
   - weekly:    the action is taken every Sunday.
   - monthly:   the action is taken on the first of every month.
   - quarterly: the action is taken on the first day of each quarter
                     (the first of January, April, July, and October)
   - yearly:    the action is taken on every first of January.


NOTE: Commas can be used to make lists of hours or days, so you
      can have: mo(6,8,10), tu(12-18,22-6), we, 3rd(4,10-14)
