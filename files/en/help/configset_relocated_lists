Both the new list name and the file name are optional.  If a new list
name is supplied, Majordomo will substitute it for the old list name in
each command that uses the old list name, and attempt to execute the
command.  If the new list name is omitted, Majordomo will not attempt to
execute any command that uses the old list name.  This makes it possible
to disable all commands for an existing mailing list, so use this
feature with caution.

In every case, when someone uses a Majordomo command the old list name,
a warning message will be displayed.  If a file name is supplied, the
contents of that file will be displayed.  If no file name is supplied,
and a new list name is supplied, the "relocated_list" error file will be
displayed.  This error file indicates that the name of the list has
changed.  If no file name is supplied, and no new list name is supplied,
the "unknown_list" error file will be displayed.  This error file
indicates that the mailing list is not supported at this domain.

The GLOBAL, DEFAULT, and ALL pseudo-lists are not affected by this
setting.
