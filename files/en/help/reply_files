                           Majordomo reply files

In response to a command, Majordomo will sometimes need to provide
the person who issued the command with extra information.  For example,
when you subscribe to a Majordomo mailing list, you will usually receive
a welcome message, part of which contains instructions for leaving the
mailing list.  These instructions are one instance of a Majordomo reply
file.

The rest of this document lists each reply file that is a standard
part of Majordomo.  It is possible for mailing list administrators
to use different reply files, through configuration settings such
as access_rules and welcome_files.

Each reply file is a template, in which Majordomo will automatically
substitute the appropriate values for certain keywords (see "help variables"
for more details).  For example, the keyword \$LIST will be replaced
by the name of the appropriate mailing list.  The substitutions supported
by each file are listed in parentheses.  The substitutions will also affect
the contents of the Subject header of the reply in many cases.
