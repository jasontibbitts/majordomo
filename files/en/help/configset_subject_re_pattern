EXAMPLE:
configset listname subject_re_pattern = \
    /(?: (?: re | sv |aw |antwort | re\^\d+ | re\[\d+\] ):\s*)+/ix

A pattern used to match Re: and other text that user mail programs
place in the subject header to indicate replies.

Majordomo uses this for two things:

1) To place the subject_prefix after the reply indicator.

2) In conjunction with subject_re_strip, to remove a number of
   accumulated reply indicators.

   Some mailers will use strings other than "Re:" in replies, such as
   "SV:", "AW:", "Re^2:", etc. as reply indicators.  When several
   mailers each insist on prepending their own reply indicators,
   messages can accumulate an annoying stack of them.  This should
   match any combination of reply indicators.
