EXAMPLE:
configset listname subject_re_pattern = \
    /(?: (?: re | sv |aw |antwort | re\^\d+ | re\[\d+\] ):\s*)+/ix

A pattern used to match Re: and other text that user mail programs
place in the subject header to indicate replies.

Majordomo uses this for three things:

1) To place the subject_prefix after the reply indicator.

2) In conjunction with subject_re_strip, to remove a number of
   accumulated reply indicators.

   Some mailers will use strings other than "Re:" in replies, such as
   "SV:", "AW:", "Re^2:", etc. as reply indicators.  When several
   mailers each insist on prepending their own reply indicators,
   messages can accumulate an annoying stack of them.  This should
   match any combination of reply indicators.

3) To sort messages by subject or thread for the archive command.
