This controls under what circumstances the original message will be
attached (as a MIME attachment) to acknowlegements sent out to inform
the user of delivery progress (as set by the user''s ack setting and
the value of the 'ack_denials_always' variable).

Each element of this array must be one of the following:

  fail  - acks for failed messages will include the original message
  stall - acks for stalls (confirmations or consultations) will
          include the original message.
  all   - acks sent for any reason will include the original message.
This command can be used to enhance replyfile or mailfile messages, it
does not generate new messages.

When a subscriber receives an acknowledgement message (a post is stalled
for owner confirmation or a post is denied), they will also receive a copy
of their post back (as a MIME attachment). This can help clarify which post
the error (deny or stall) message applies to.

If users are posting huge files, returning it may be good (they realize
how long it took to receive) or bad (you load up your server returning it).

   help set                     (for subscribers to set the "ack" flag)
