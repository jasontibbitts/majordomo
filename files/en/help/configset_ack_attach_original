# This controls under what circumstances the original message will be
# attached (as a MIME attachment) to acknowlegements sent out to inform
# the user of delivery progress (as set by the user''s ack setting and
# the value of the 'ack_denials_always' variable).
#
# Each element of this array must be one of the following:
#
#   fail  - acks for failed messages will include the original message
#   stall - acks for stalls (confirmations or consultations) will
#           include the original message.
#   all   - acks sent for any reason will include the original message.

addendum to Majordomo2 "configset ack_attach_original" File - updated 24 Feb 99

This command can be used to enhance replyfile or mailfile messages, it
does not generate new messages.

When a subscriber receives an acknowledgement message (a post is stalled
for owner confirmation or a post is denied), they will also receive a copy
of their post back (as a MIME attachment). This can help clarify which post
the error (deny or stall) message applies to.

If users are posting huge files, returning it may be good (they realize
how long it took to receive) or bad (you load up your server returning it).

==> see also: configset access_rules  (for how to specify replyfiles)
==> see also: configset default_flags (for pre-setting the "ack" flag)
==> see also: set                     (for subscribers to set the "ack" flag)
