Including the original message with an acknowledgement message can give
the recipient a better idea to which posted message the acknowledgement
refers.

The acknowledgement message itself can be chosen using the "replyfile"
action in the access_rules setting for the "fail" and "stall" results.
By default, the acknowledgement files used are ack_success, ack_stall, 
ack_rejection, and ack_denial.  See "help reply_files" for a description 
of each file.

See Also:
   help admin_moderate
   help configset_access_rules  (for how to specify replyfiles)
   help configset_default_flags (for pre-setting the "ack" flag)
   help configset_nonmember_flags
   help reply_files
   help set                     (for subscribers to set the "ack" flag)
