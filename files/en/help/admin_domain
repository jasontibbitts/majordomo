                          Managing Virtual Domains

Each Majordomo installation is capable of supporting one or many virtual
domains.  Each domain, likewise, is capable of supporting one or many
electronic mailing lists.  In an attempt to make management easier, some
characteristics are shared by all of the mailing lists within a domain.
However, there is at present no sharing between different domains at
the same site.

There are two ways to add virtual domains.  The first way is to reinstall
the software entirely, answering the questions about each virtual domain
that the site manager wishes to support.  The second way is to run the
"make domain" shell command from the Majordomo source directory.

Each domain has two special pseudo-lists, GLOBAL and DEFAULT.  

The GLOBAL pseudo-list is used to manage Majordomo commands which are
not specific to any one mailing list.   These commands include
accept, alias, changeaddr, createlist, password, register, reject, rekey,
sessioninfo, show, tokeninfo, unalias, unregister, and which.  

The DEFAULT pseudo-list is used to provide default configuration settings
to all of the mailing lists except the GLOBAL pseudo-list.  When Majordomo
attempts to determine the current value of a configuration setting for a 
mailing list, it first checks the table of settings for the list itself.
This table will only contain values if the list owners have explicitly
added them with the configset command.  In contrast, the configdef command 
is used to remove values from the table.  If a configuration setting has no 
entry in the list's table, the DEFAULT list is checked next.  If the setting has 
no entry in table for the DEFAULT list, a default value is supplied by the 
software.

The DEFAULT list is valuable because it allows you to change the settings
of all of the mailing lists within a domain at once.  It has been suggested
that one DEFAULT list is not enough.  If your site has two or more basic styles
of mailing list (discussion lists and announcement lists, for example) for
which you would like to provide default settings, it would be helpful to
choose which set of default values to use for each list.  Unfortunately,
this has not yet been implemented.

The most important use of the DEFAULT list is to configure each domain
to supply at least one digest to each mailing list, using the "digests"
configuration setting.  Majordomo does not define any digests by default
(see "help configset_digests" for more details).
  
The DEFAULT and GLOBAL lists can also be used to make files available
to all of the mailing lists within a domain.  See "help get" and 
"help configset file_share" for more details.  There is also a Stock
directory for files that are supplied by Majordomo, like this help
file.  These files can be obtained using the get command, and replaced
using the put command; however, there is no way to overwrite the files
in the Stock directory.  If you use the get and put commands to edit
and improve the files, your changes will only affect one domain at
a site.  If you wish to make changes to Stock files that affect all
domains, you will need to edit the files in the Majordomo source
distribution and reinstall the software.

Each domain has several databases which apply to all of the mailing
lists within that domain.  

* The subscriber registry that keeps the personal password and other 
information about each e-mail address that is subscribed to a mailing
list at that domain.  This registry is separate from the individual
subscriber database for each mailing list.

* The token identifiers for requests that have been delayed, or
require confirmation or approval from the moderators of a mailing list.

* The alias database, which allows subscribers to tell Majordomo that
two e-mail addresses should be treated the same.

* The duplicate databases, which store data about every message that is
delivered to a mailing list within the domain.  This allows subscribers
to avoid cross-posted messages, using the "unique" delivery class
(see "help set" for an explanation of delivery classes).

The GLOBAL list shares (only) four configuration settings with all
of the other mailing lists in the same domain.  These settings
are admin_body, admin_headers, taboo_body, and taboo_headers.  These
settings are combined with a mailing list's individual settings when
Majordomo attempts to find prohibited content in posted messages.

Majordomo automatically maintains the GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list, which
contains the addresses of all mailing list owners within a domain.
A site or domain owner who wishes to contact all of the list owners
at once can do so with the announce command.  In addition, a list of
these addresses, together with the names of the mailing lists that
each administrates, can be seen with the following command:
  who-owners GLOBAL
