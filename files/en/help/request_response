The "request_response" action is used in the access_rules configuration
setting to determine who has access to an autoresponder.

Every mailing list has a "-request" e-mail address.  Normally, messages
sent to this address will be processed as if they were sent to the 
server at $MJ.

It is possible to configure the "-request" address to send an automated
reply message instead.  This is accomplished with the following command:

  configset GLOBAL request_answer = response

This change affects all of the mailing lists at a domain; there is no
way to change this on a list-by-list basis.

The domain administrator may wish to restrict access to the automated
replies, using the GLOBAL access_rules setting.  For example, the following
command:

configset GLOBAL access_rules <<LLL
request_response
deny
/example.edu/
LLL

would deny access to everyone outside of the example.edu domain.
