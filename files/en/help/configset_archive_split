# archive_split        /yearly,monthly,weekly,daily/
# (monthly)            [enum] <archive>
# A word describing how the archive files should be split.  Here are the
# possibilities, along with sample names of the archive files:
#
#   yearly  - 1999.00
#   monthly - 199903.00
#   weekly  - 20021031.00
#   daily   - 21121002.00
#
# Note that archives will be further split by size; see the archive_size
# variable.  This gives rise to the two trailing digits, which may not be
# present depending on the archive_size setting.
#
# Also note that changing this variable will only change the settings for new
# messages; old archives will not be renamed or altered in any way.
