If you wish to rename archive files after they have been created, it
will be necessary to use the put command to store the messages in new
files.  The archive-delete and put-delete commands should be used  to 
delete the old archive files.  Finally, the archive-sync command should
be used to regenerate the archive databases for the new archive files.
