addendum to Majordomo2 "configset taboo_header" File - updated 25 Jan 99

NOTE: For help on taboo_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers. Just substitute the string "taboo_" wherever you
see "admin_" in that help file.

See "help configset access_rules" for how to send informative messages
when one of the taboo_headers lines matches.

   help topics
   help configset_taboo_headers_global
to the server at $MJ
