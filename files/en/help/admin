Section 1 - Introduction to "help admin"

Below are many techniques a list administrator may want to use, but
some commands and many options are left out. For a complete set of all
available commands, send "help topics" to $MJ

This file is specific to administrators! To get suggestions from a
user's perspective (as a list subscriber) send "help overview" or
"help commands" to the server.

To get top-level help, send "help" on a line by itself to the server.
To get a brief description of command syntax, send "help admin commands".
For information on variable substitution and nested file inclusion in
help files and other messages the server may send out, see "help put"
and "help variables".

Section 2 - Where to Send Email (or "don't bug the wrong person")

All Majordomo2 commands are sent to the server at $MJ
(this includes things like "subscribe", "help", "lists", etc)
If you have shell access, refer to "help mj_shell" for an
alternative to sending email to the server.

To send a post (also called a broadcast) to an email list called
"LISTNAME", just send email to LISTNAME@$WHEREAMI
(of course "LISTNAME" is replaced with the actual name of the list)


  DO NOT SEND MAJORDOMO COMMANDS TO THE EMAIL LIST ITSELF!
  Go back and read the two paragraphs above if you have any questions.


To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
owner address, which is formed by adding "-owner" to the list name.
For instance, to contact the list owner for the list "LISTNAME",
you would send email to LISTNAME-owner@$WHEREAMI

A human site administrator should be available at $MJOWNER
but don't expect the overall admin to answer questions in detail!
(save this address for when a list owner can't help you...)

NOTE: This section is replicated in "help overview".


+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

Section 3 - The Text Parser (how Majordomo reads your commands)

The text parser is the part of Majordomo that takes a body of text and
extracts the commands from it.  In the simplest case it just parses
commands, one per line.  It can, however, do much more.

The parser only looks in text/plain parts for commands.  Other parts are
discarded.  Lines beginning with '#' are considered to be comments, and are
ignored.  Lines ending in '\' are joined to the next line.

The parser will check for the validity of each command and report errors.
It will also skip large amounts of errors, reporting the count of lines
skipped.  If necessary, a default list will be added based on the default
list supplied to the parser.

If the command line ends in '<<' and a word in upper case, all lines
between the command line and one consisting only of the specified word are
taken as additional arguments to the command.  Then the command routine is
called and the results are reported. See the "help admin commands" or
"help commands" files for syntax details on how to read files or email
attachments directly as input instead of using the '<<' method.

The 'approve' command runs the given command (and arguments) with the
supplied password.  Essentially any command can be executed with
privileges using the approve command.  The 'default' command makes it
much easier to approve several commands at once by setting certain
defaults for the duration of the parsing (currently only implemented
for password and listname, the default command will one day have a
language and prefix option). Refer to these help files for details:
   help approve
   help default




+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

Section 4 - List Configuration (how an owner sets list options)

All aspects of list configuration and most aspects of Majordomo
configuration are alterable remotely using the configuration interface.
This interface allows single variables or sets of variables to be retrieved
and modified individually, and for variables to be set without first
retrieving their value.  The result of a variable retrieval is a set of
commands ready to be edited and mailed back.

The configuration interface makes use of three commands: configshow,
configset and configdefault.  In addition, the shell interface (for local
users) supports the configedit command.

NOTE: The output of "configshow-comments" has been stored for every
      configset variable, and is available through the help system:
      The command "help configset VARIABLE" sent to $MJ,
      where "VARIABLE" is replaced with the configset variable you
      want details on, will return both the default comments and
      (in some cases) annotations showing operation which differs
      from the configshow comments and/or further explantion of
      how the command works. use "help configset" with no variable
      name to get a list of all possible variables and other info.


Configset or Configedit:
  configset changes the value of the given variable.  It takes as arguments
  the list (or GLOBAL for global configuration), the variable to be changed,
  and the value.  The value for scalar variables (those containing only a
  single value) are supplied with an equals sign; array and table values are
  set with the '<< TAG' syntax (see below). Configedit does the same thing
  from a command line instead of through email.

Configshow:
  configshow displays the value of a configuration variable.  This display
  includes the commands necessary to set the variable; this makes it simple
  to issue a configshow, edit the result and send it back to the server.
  Refer to "help configshow" for more details on this command.

Configdefault:
  The configdefault command sets the value of a variable back to its default
  value.  Not only that, but variables set to their default values will track
  changes made to the defaults file, so that a change made to the defaults
  file will update the values of the relevant variables in all lists that
  have not set the variables otherwise.  The configdefault command takes the
  list and the name of the variable to be defaulted.

The Old Interface:
  Note that the old Majordomo1 commands are not yet supported, but they
  essentially translate as follows:
    config      -> configshow=comments list ALL
    newconfig   -> not required; output of configshow contains appropriate
                   commands 
    writeconfig -> not required; config file is stored internally in a manner
                   that makes this unnecessary


+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

Section 5 - Passwords (global, list, master, subsidiary)

NOTE: There are also "personal passwords" for list subscribers. The
passwords discussed in this section are for administration of the
site or lists. Refer to "help password" for personal password info. 

The Majordomo system implements most of its security through the use of
passwords.  Providing a password causes the system to bypass the normal
access checks; if the password is valid and carries the proper
authorizations, the action will be carried out.  This enables a list owner
to administer the list from various addresses and to give others
administration duties simply by giving out passwords.

There are various overlapping classes of passwords:

*) Global passwords.
   These passwords are authorized to perform actions on all lists at a
   site.

*) List passwords.
   These can affect only a single list.

*) Master passwords.
   These are authorized to perform any action on the list.  The global
   master password is allowed to perform every action on every list.

*) Subsidiary passwords.
   The list owner (actually anyone who has the list's master password or
   the global master password) can create an unlimited number of passwords
   and authorize each to do different things.

The concept of subsidiary passwords is powerful.  One (or, perhaps, more
than one) password can be authorized to perform subscriptions while another
can bypass access restrictions on posting messages.  Passwords can be
authorized to do more than one thing, or to do anything except see or
change any of the password.  (Only the master passwords are authorized to
do that.)

In addition, subsidiary passwords can be bound to email addresses.  This is
not intended to give a large amount of additional security; email can be
forged trivially and a user with a password authorized to carry out the
'alias' action can simply equate his address to one which is authorized to
do some other action.  Still, since the passwords themselves are hidden
from view, it prevents casual password guessing.

Note that master passwords cannot be bound to addresses.  If this is
desired, it is best to create a subsidiary password authorized to do 'ALL'.
Some sites may even choose not to give master passwords to list owners.

For information on how to actually set up and change passwords,
send these two lines to $MJ
   help configset master_password
   help configset passwords
and for information on how to apply passwords, see
   help approve
   help default


+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +

Section 6 - Creating and Running Lists (all the other stuff you need)

6.1 - Creating a list:

  You will probably have to add something to PATH or type the full path to
  mj_shell for mj_shell to work, and you have to have access to a shell
  command line on the computer that receives Majordomo commands. If you
  don't have access to mj_shell, just send the following commands to the
  server by email.

  If you start mj_shell without arguments, it will respond with some
  instructions and a 'Majordomo>' prompt.  If you have the appropriate modules
  installed, you may have interactive editing capabilities although those
  modules often have some trouble on some OSes.

  You can make your own list 'test-list' owned by someone@example.com
  just by issuing the createlist command...

  - from an interactive shell:
      % mj_shell -d example.com -p password
      Majordomo> createlist test-list someone@example.com

  - from a shell command line
      % mj_shell -d example.com -p password createlist test-list someone@example.com

  - or send email to $MJ
      approve password createlist test-list someone@example.com

  This will give you the necessary aliases to add to the appropriate file, if
  you're running Sendmail.  Note that for sites running virtual domains the
  suggestions may not be completely correct and additions to other files (the
  virtusertable, most likely). See "help createlist" for details.

  Help is always available; send the command
   help topics
  to see a list of available help topics.

  Now to configure this list.  This should do everything necessary, although
  some aspects of your MTA configuration may cause the list addresses to not
  be immediately availabile.

  The default configuration of this list may be reasonable (as the defaults
  are designed to mirror Majordomo 1.94.4 behavior), but there are some
  variables you will want to play with:

  - from an interactive shell:
      Majordomo> configedit test-list subject_prefix

  - or send email to $MJ
      approve password configshow test-list subject_prefix
    (edit the email you get back)
      approve password configset test-list subject_prefix ...
    (send back the edited text)

  This will open an editor on the subject_prefix variable, with a short
  description of the variable present.  Note that in Mj2, users have the
  choice of receiving a subject prefix so you probably want to configure
  one.  The same goes for 'reply_to' and other interesting variables.

  If you want digests or archiving, you must make a directory to store
  archived messages:
     put-dir test-list /public/archive Message Archives
  Now archives will accumulate, and are accessible using the get command.  If
  you want some digests, do
     Majordomo> configedit test-list digests
  and set up one or more.  Users can use the 'set' command to choose whether
  they want each message or a digest.  They can choose which of the digests
  you've defined and what kind of digest they want (text, MIME, or index).
  They can also set various other parameters using 'set'


6.2 - Moving a list from Majordomo 1.9x:

  You can pull in a set of addresses from a Majordomo 1.9x list like this:
     mj_shell -p password -f old-list-file subscribe=quiet,noinform list-name
  which subscribes all addresses from a file, without welcoming them and
  without sending an informational notification to the list owner.
  If you copy the old configuration file into the directory for the new list,
  it will be automatically created.


6.3 - Simple logs for debugging;

  Majordomo2 stores information about every email or command line processed
  in files called sessions.  These are files containing all pertinent
  information about the session (email headers, CGI environment, selected
  environment variables, etc. as appropriate) as well as a log of all
  commands executed during that session.  When a token is rejected,
  information about the session that generated it is automatically mailed to
  the list and site owners (if they elect to receive such information).
  See "help configset debug" for more information.


6.4 - Where the files are:

  Please refer to "help put" for details on the directory structure used
  by Majordomo2... especially if you have shell access and plan to edit
  or create files by hand (using the operating system shell). Links and/or
  manually created files will work, but only if the ownership permissions
  are right.

  Each list has a directory where retrievable files are stored; this is
  called a filespace.  Because normal filesystems do not track enough
  information about file types, Majordomo2 maintains a database containing
  information about these files such as their description and MIME type.  The
  list owner can upload files to the filespace and users can retrieve files
  from the public portion of the filespace.

  When retrieving a file from the filespace, Majordomo2 consults a search
  list made from the 'file_search' config variable and a global default.
  Other list's files can be referenced as long as they share their files.
  Since Majordomo2 goes through the filespace to send out nearly all of its
  messages, this provides both an overrideable defaults mechanism and a means
  for internationalization.

  Files are uploaded using the 'put' command; 'put-dir' will make
  directories.  There is currently no way to delete a file.  The 'newinfo',
  'newintro' and 'newfaq' commands are shortcuts for 'put' with specific
  arguments.

  Files are retrieved with the 'get' command; 'get=immediate' will return the
  file inline instead of mailing it as a separate message.  The 'intro',
  'info' and 'faq' commands are shortcuts for 'get' with specific arguments.

  A (partial) list of the response files that Majordomo2 uses are given, with
  supported variable expansions, in "help put". You will also find a list of
  variables that can be substituted as a file is sent to the user, and how to
  automatically include one file within another file.


6.5 - List Archives:

  Archives start accumulating as soon as the archive_dir variable is set and
  the directory exists, or as soon as an "archive" directory appears in the
  public area of the list's filespace.  The latter can be done by the command
     put-dir LISTNAME /public/archive Archives
  (properly approved, of course). You can use the "configset archive_dir"
  command to put the directory elsewhere. There is no need to create additional
  aliases.  Archives are free of fronters, footers, most header modifications
  and subject prefixing. (For example, "message_headers" and "subject_prefix"
  will not be in the archives.) The archive system will automatically create a
  ".index" directory to place various indices.

  The archive is in the standard Unix mailbox format (usable by mail readers
  such as elm and /usr/bin/mail). You get a list of messages from the people
  who posted, as you would expect. This standard format can be imported directly
  into Eudora (on Windoze PCs): just copy the file into the directory Eudora
  looks at and restart Eudora. On Unix systems, just read the archive directly
  with "/usr/bin/mail -f archive_file_path".

  The archive directory can be a symbolic link without problems, although it
  cannot be created that way from within Majordomo.  The usual reason for this
  is to permit the archives to be in an FTP area.

  (Archives will be needed in order for digests to work. There will be
  provisions for old archives to automatically be removed, in case long-term
  archiving is not desired.)

  Refer to these help files for additional information on archive files:
   help configset archive_dir
   help configset archive_size
   help configset archive_split
   help configset filedir
   help configset get_access
   help configset index_access


6.6 - Access Control:

  All operations which need to restrict access go through a central mechanism
  for doing so.  The list owner can choose to use the old Majordomo 1
  interface which works via the *_access variables, restrict_post,
  subscribe_policy and the like.  This works as expected (though the
  mechanism by which restrict_post lists are set up has changed).

  The owner can also choose to make use of an extremely flexible system which
  is documented in the "help configset access_rules" file.  This, when
  coupled with some of the admin_* and taboo_* extensions (like severity and
  classes) and the metrics that resend collects allows almost arbitrarily
  complex access control. (see "help configset admin_body" for details!)

  Instead of Majordomo 1's limitation of confirming only subscribes, almost
  any operation can be stalled and completed after a conformation token is
  returned by either the user or the owner (or both).  The owner can also
  choose to deny outright a request.

  To keep subscriber lists private, you should use "configset access_rules"
  to disable or limit use of "who", "which", and "show". There are commands
  (see "help configset who_access" and "help configset which_access") for
  who and which, but the show command can only be limited with access_rules.

  Information about a token can be retrieved as indicated in "help showtokens".

6.7 - Administrative Command Modes:

  The commands you send to Majordomo often have a command "mode" which
  alters the behavior of the command.  For example, in the command
    lists-short-enhanced 
  the command mode is "short-enhanced".

  Majordomo offers four command modes that can be applied to any 
  command, and are only useful to list owners and site administrators.

  noinform - Do not send an informational message to the list owners.
    The "inform" configuration setting determines when a message
    would normally be sent.  See "help configset inform" for more
    details.

  nolog - Do not log the result of this command.
    For each Majordomo request, one line describing the request 
    and its result is normally added to a global log file.  The 
    contents of the log file can be displayed using the "report" command.
    A site or domain password is required to use this mode.

  quiet - Do not send a notice when a delay token is created.
    It is possible for you to delay the completion of a request
    until later;  see the description of the "default delay"
    command in "help default" for details.  When a request is
    delayed, a notice is usually sent to the person whom the 
    request affects.  That person can follow the instructions
    in the notice to keep the request from being fulfilled, or
    to complete the request immediately. 

  rule - Turn off the "access_password_override" setting temporarily.
    Usually, when you use the master password for a mailing list,
    your requests are completed right away.  This mode causes
    the privileges of the master password to be suspended.  The
    access rules and other restrictions are applied as usual.
    See "help configset access_password_override" for a practical
    example.
    
A site, domain, or list master password is required to use these
four command modes.

Section 7 - Cookbook for common list owner problems

This section contains examples of how you would solve certain problems.
The answers are probably not complete; in many cases Mj2 is so flexible
that there are many ways to solve the problem.

---------------------------

7.1 - Problem: How can I have a list with 30 members but allow
      posting by 300 specific addresses and nobody else?


7.1.1 - first Solution (no auxiliary files):
  Sign everyone up, but put the people who don't want to get anything in the
  class 'nomail'.  (set blah-list nomail address@host.dom).  This means the
  people who can post are real subscribers; they just don't get any
  messages.  Set restrict_post appropriately:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  END

  to close off posting to the list.


7.1.2 - second Solution (most like Majordomo 1):
  Sign up the recipient users as usual, and put everyone else in
  a sublist like this:

     auxadd blah-list posters address@host.dom

  (where "blah-list" is the main list and "posters" is the sublist)
  then restrict posting to the main list and that sublist:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  posters
  END


7.1.3 - third Solution (most flexible):
  Sign up the recipient users, put everyone else in a sublist, make a file
  explaining that only members can post, 'put' it with the name
  'membersonly', and make an access rule:

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny, replyfile=membersonly
  !@MAIN && !@posters
  END

  This rule denies all postings from users who are not in the main list and
  are not in the 'posters' sublist.  They will be sent the named denial
  message if they try to post.  Be sure you either have
  'always_ack_denials' set or you have 'a' or 'A' in 'nonmember_flags' so
  that users will see these messages.  Also put 'fail' (or 'all') in
  'ack_attach_original' if you would like these users to receive a copy of
  their message back with the rejection notice.

  The 'deny' can be changed to 'consult' to let the list owner approve the
  messages if desired, as with the other two solutions.

---------------------------

7.2 - Problem: How do I let everyone in a certain domain post while
      requiring approval for all other domains?

7.2 - Solution:
  First note that headers can be forged and so if people really want to
  bypass a header-based restriction they can. For protection against most
  non-malicious spammers, add a simple access rule as shown below.

  We'll use the 'no' (Norway) domain as the first example. This ruke
  consults the list owner(s) for all addresses not ending in '.no':

  access_rules <<END
  post
  consult
  !/\.no$/
  END

---------------------------

7.3 - Problem: How do I keep anyone, or a certain domain, from posting
      while allowing all other users and domains to post freely?

7.3.1 - backward-compatible Solution: see "help configset restrict_post"

7.3.2 - access_rules Solution:
  First note that headers can be forged and so if people really want to
  bypass a header-based restriction they can. Often what you REALLY
  want is to keep one user from posting while allowing everyone else
  to post, but the "freebie" domains make it easy to create new accounts
  and cause trouble.

  Here is how to lock out one domain, using Yahoo as an example. Note
  that the '@' and '.' characters need to be escaped with "\", and
  refer to "help patterns" for details on regular expressions:

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny
  /\@yahoo\.com$/
  END

  Here is how to lock out TWO domains, using Yahoo and MSN, and you
  can add more domains to the list as needed:

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny
  /\@yahoo\.com$/ OR /\@msn\.com$/
  END

  Here is how to lock out the entire Yahoo domain, and also any email
  address from any domain which contains the string "calliger":

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny
  /\@yahoo\.com$/i OR /calliger/i
  END

---------------------------

7.4 - Problem: How to I stop massive crossposting between lists
      at my site and perhaps lists at other sites, too?

7.4 Solution:
  You can do this using taboo_headers matches and an access rule.

  First create and 'put' a file called 'nocrossposting' explaining how
  crossposting between your lists and between your and others are not
  allowed.

  Then put some entries into taboo_headers:

taboo_headers <<END
/^(to|cc):.*some-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*some-other-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*another-related-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*yet-another-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*and-another/i 10,crosspost
END

  These look like normal taboo_headers entries, with a twist: the
  information on the end contains a 'score' (or a 'severity') and a name.
  Taboo matches can be given names; when one of them matches, the score is
  added to that name.  So for every match, ten points are added to the
  'crosspost' match.  Note that if you included your own list there, the
  match will start out at 10.

  Now, you have to test the score of the 'crosspost' match and do something
  with the message if it matches too many times.  This is done with a few
  lines in the access_rules variable:

access_rules <<END
post
deny, replyfile=nocrossposting
$taboo_crosspost >= 30
END

  This will deny the message and mail out your 'nocrossposting' file if the
  score gets to 30 or above.  If your list is not matched by any of the
  taboo_headers lines, this means that the message will be sent back to the
  poster if it is crossposted to three or more lists.  You can adjust the
  '30' to meet your needs.  You can also adjust the individual scores;
  perhaps some lists are OK to crosspost to but you still want to stamp out
  excessive crossposting, so you could give the taboo lines matching those
  lists scores of 5 or so.

  Note that because each of your lists doesn't know what comes in to your
  other lists, the poster will get several rejection notices.

---------------------------

7.5 - Problem: I want people to read my list for a few days before they post.

7.5 - Solution:
  You can do this using access_rules and the $days_since_subscribe variable:

access_rules <<END
post
deny, replyfile=membersonly
!@
post
consult, replyfile=waitawhile
$days_since_subscribe < 3
END

  Write and upload a suitable files called 'membersonly' and 'waitawhile'
  and they will be sent to nonmembers and new menbers, respectively (where
  new members are those who have been signed up for less than three days).
  Nonmembers will be rejected out of hand, while new members will have to
  wait for the list owner to approve their messages.

---------------------------

7.6 - Problem: One of the subscribers wants to change her address from 
      jane@example.com to ruth@example.net.  How can she do this?


7.6.1 - Solution when she still has access to the old account:

Sending email from 'ruth@example.net', she can send this one-line command:
  changeaddr jane@example.com


7.6.2 - Solution when email cannot be sent from the old account:

Anyone, including 'jane@example.net' can send the following two commands:
  default user ruth@example.net
  changeaddr jane@example.com
following which both accounts will be required to return a token before
the change takes effect. This will work when the old account is set to
forward somewhere else, because the token can be returned from any address.
It will NOT work if the old account is completely gone, since the user
will not know what token to send back.

If the site administrator uses the master password, neither address will
need to confirm the change:
  default password SITEPASSWORD
  default user ruth@example.net
  changeaddr jane@example.com

If the password for the old address is used, only the new address will
need to confirm by returning a token:
