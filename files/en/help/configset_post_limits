EXAMPLE:
configset listname post_limits <<ENDTAG
/example.com/ | 3/20 | 5/3d12h,10/1m
ENDTAG


The "post_limits" variable controls the per-address or per-domain limits
for posting messages to a list. The format of each line is:
  pattern | soft_limit_conditions[,more] | hard_limit_conditions[,more]
The pattern will be matched against the e-mail address of the author
of the message.  The conditions will be applied if the pattern matches.
(See "help configseet post_limits" for syntax details, and "help patterns"
for details on regular expressions.)

The two required conditions determine the "soft" and "hard" limits,
respectively. Each set of conditions is a comma-separated list of ratios
and/or frequencies, and if an address matching the pattern has posted
too many times a hard or soft limit will be applied. Exceeding a soft
limit causes the list owne to be consulted by default, while exceeding
a hard limit causes the post to be denied by default. Hard limits take
precedence, and what happens when either kind of limit is reached can
be controlled by the list owner (see "help configset access_rules").

The format of post_limits is a series of lines containing a pattern,
a comma-separated list of soft limits, and a comma-separated list of
hard limits. For the example above, all example.com addresses would
be soft limited to 3 messages out of the last 20 (the list owner would
be consulted if that percentage were exceeded), and hard limited to 5
in the last 3.5 days or 10 in the last month (the attempted post would
be denied without bothering the list owner).

Conditions are expressed as ratios (the number of posts out of a group
of posts), or frequencies (the number of posts in a period of time). For
example, "3/10" means three messages out of the last ten messages, and
"5/1w" means five messages in the last week. The number to the left of
the slash is always the number of posts to be counted, the number(s) on
the right of the slash represent the following:
  number of posts:  no letter       after the number (as in 5/10)
  number of days:   'd' or 'days'   after the number (as in 5/3d)
  number of weeks:  'w' or 'weeks'  after the number (as in 5/2w)
  number of months: 'm' or 'months' after the number (as in 5/1m)

Note that a limit of 3/10 (3 out of the last 10) would be exceeded if
not 3 but 4 or more out of 10 messages were posted from the same address.
The number you specify is the number allowable, any more are limited.

There is a new "post" trigger to expire data from the "posts" database.
The post data has a lifetime twice that of the dup_lifetime setting, at
the moment, so make sure your conditions are no longer than twice the
duplicate message database lifespan (see "help configset dup_lifetime).
