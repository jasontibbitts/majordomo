If any of the headers matches one of these regexps, then the message
will be bounced for review.

NOTE: For help on taboo_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers. Just substitute the string "taboo_" wherever you
see "admin_" in that help file.

See "help configset access_rules" for how to send informative messages
when one of the taboo_headers lines matches.
