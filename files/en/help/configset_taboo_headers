EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL taboo_headers << ENDTAG
/X-Loop:/ 1,headers
ENDTAG


If any of the headers matches one of these regexps, then the message
will be bounced for review. Syntax is described in "help configset admin_body".

NOTE: For help on taboo_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers. Just substitute the string "taboo_" wherever you
see "admin_" in that help file.

See "help configset access_rules" for how to send informative messages
when one of the taboo_headers lines matches.

There are other header traps in place: See "help configset block_headers"
for a description of headers which are both added and looked for.
(Specifically, X-Loop has special meaning!)

The admin_body, admin_headers, noarchive_body, noarchive_headers,
taboo_body, and taboo_headers settings have a special characteristic.
When these six settings are applied to a message that has been posted to
a mailing list, the patterns in the GLOBAL settings are also used.
