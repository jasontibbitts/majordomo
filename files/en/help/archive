If a Majordomo mailing list is configured to store messages in
an archive, those messages may be retrieved using the "archive-get"
and "archive-index" commands. The index and get commands will not
allow archive retrieval if "archive_dir" is set to somewhere outside
the list's file space, but in many cases it will be possible to.

Majordomo archives are given names which indicate the dates of
the messages in the archive.  For example, the "test" list's archive
for the month of March, 1999, would be called
  test.199903
Archives may be organized by year, month, week, or day, at the 
discretion of the list owners.

Within each archive, each message will have a number.  For instance,
the seventh message in the March, 1999, archive would have the following
number:
  199903/7

It is possible to retrieve messages (with the "archive-get" command)
or a list of messages, with each message's subject and message
number (using the "archive-index" command).  There are several
ways for you to indicate which messages you want to see, using
three kinds of patterns.

One pattern is a simple message count.  For example,
  archive-index test 20
would retrieve an index of the last 20 messages sent to the "test" list.

Another pattern is a message number.  For example,
  archive-get test 199903/4
would retrieve the fourth message in the March, 1999, archive of
the "test" list.

The final pattern is a number which expresses a date.  The command
  archive-index plum 19990814
would retrieve an index of messages posted to the "plum" list
on August 14, 1999.  Similarly, the command
  archive-get peach 2000021
will cause all of the messages posted to the "peach" list during
the first week of February, 2000, to be sent to you.

These three patterns may be combined to indicate ranges of messages.
The command
  archive-get almond 20000205 - 20000207
would retrieve all messages distributed on the "almond" list
during the 5th, 6th, and 7th of February, 2000.  It is very
important to leave spaces around the hyphen.  The command
  archive-get almond 20000205-20000207
will NOT work.

Any combination of the three patterns may be used.  However, some
of the combinations produce unusual effects.  For example,
  archive-index lime 15 - 3
would retrieve an index of the 15 messages immediately preceding
the third most recent message sent to the "lime" list.

The command
  archive-get lemon 200001/3 - 15
will retrieve the third message in the January, 2000, archive of
the "lemon" list, and 14 messages following it, even if those
messages are found in other archives, such as February, 2000, or
later.

Whereas
  archive-index tangerine 10 - 1998
would retrieve an index of the last 10 messages posted to the
"tangerine" list during 1998, 
  archive-index tangerine 1998 - 10
would retrieve an index of the first 10 messages.
