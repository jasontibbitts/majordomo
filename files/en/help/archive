NOTE: 

If a Majordomo mailing list is configured to store messages in
an archive, it is possible to retrieve messages (with "archive-get")
or obtain a list of messages with each message's subject and message
number (using "archive-index"). Messages sent to auxiliary lists are
also archived, and made available using the archive-get command with
an extra argument.

The type of digest for the archive-get command can be specified in
the mode: "archive-get-mime" sends a multi-part MIME message, just
"archive-get" sends plain text. The original format of the messages
shouldn't matter.

List archives may be organized by year, month, week, or day, at the 
discretion of the list owners. The configuration of the list does
not affect the use of "archive" commands, but refer to "help index"
and "help get" for other ways to directly access the archive files
without using "archive-index" and "archive-get".

Different "filespec" syntax applies to different archive options:
  Section 1: archive-index, archive-get, archive-get-mime (users)
  Section 2: archive-delete, archive-stats (list administrators only)
  Section 3: archive-sync (list admins with file system access only)

The -get and -index options are the only "archive" command that list
subscribers can use. They allow listing and retrieval of messages.

The options "archive-delete" and "archive-sync" are intended only
for use by expert list owners, and "-sync" in particular will be
useful only to those with shell access who wish to hand-edit the
archives (a practice which is possible but discouraged). Both of
these options require an administrative password.

Section 1: archive-index, archive-get, archive-get-mime (users)


The "filespec" needed for these "archive" commands can take various
forms, and examples of each are shown below:
  count
  date
  date/message_number
  auxlist.date
  auxlist.date/message_number
  filespec1 - filespec2

The "count" form gets the number of messages you ask for, ending with
the last message posted to the list.

Dates can be specified in several formats, as detailed in the "Time Stamp"
section of "help times".

Within each archive, each message will have a number, and that number
must be used to retrieve a single message. Without it, you can retrieve
messages covering a range of dates but cannot select a single message.

The "filespec1 - filespec2" form MUST have spaces on each side of the
dash, and the two filespec fields can be any of the other forms. When
a dash is used, all messages in the range specified are processed. See
the examples below for additional notes on range usage and interactions
between the two fields of the range.

Example 1: "filespec" is a simple message count (not often used)
    archive-index test 20
  would retrieve an index of the last 20 messages sent to the "test" list,
    archive-get test 20
  would retrieve the twenty messages themselves.

Example 2: "filespec" is a date (usually used with -index, not -get)
    archive-index test 1999
  shows all messages in all of the 1999 archives of the "test" list.
    archive-get test 199903
  retrieves all messages in the March 1999 archive of the "test" list.
    archive-index test 19990305
  shows only messages posted on the "test" list the day of 5 March 1999.
  (Refer to "help times" for details of the date field syntax.)

Example 3: "filespec" includes a message number (from "archive-index")
    archive-get test 199903/4
  retrieves the 4th message in the March 1999 archive of the "test" list.

Example 4: "filespec" includes an auxiliary list
    archive-get test bugs.199903
  retrieves all messages in the March 1999 archive of the auxiliary list
  "bugs" of the main list "test".

Example 5: "filespec" includes an auxiliary list AND a message number
    archive-get test bugs.199903/4
  retrieves the 4th in the March 1999 archive of the auxiliary list
  "bugs" of the main list "test".

Example 6: "filespec1 - filespec2" includes a range of dates
    archive-get almond 20000205 - 20000207
  would retrieve all messages distributed on the "almond" list
  during the 5th, 6th, and 7th of February, 2000.
  WARNING: "20000205-20000207" will NOT WORK - you must include spaces!

Example 7: "filespec1 - filespec2" has decreasing "count" fields
    archive-index lime 15 - 3
  would retrieve an index of the 15 messages immediately preceding
  the 3rd most recent message sent to the "lime" list. This unusual
  result is because the last field of the range (3) indicates the
  range ends with the 3rd most recent post. The start of the range,
  as with a single message count, counts backwards from the end.

Example 8: "filespec1 - filespec2" has a message number and a count
    archive-get lemon 200001/3 - 15
  will retrieve the third message in the January, 2000, archive of
  the "lemon" list, and 14 messages FOLLOWING it, even if those
  messages are found in other archives, such as February 2000, or
  later. Note that the count field does NOT go back in time from
  the date field, but goes forward instead!

Example 9: "filespec1 - filespec2" has a count and then a date field
    archive-index tangerine 10 - 1998
  would retrieve an index of the LAST TEN messages posted to the
  "tangerine" list during 1998.

Example 10: "filespec1 - filespec2" has a date and then a count field
    archive-index tangerine 1998 - 10
  would retrieve an index of the FIRST TEN messages posted to the
  "tangerine" list during 1998.

The index and get commands may not allow archive retrieval if
"configset archive_dir" is set to somewhere outside the list's
file space, but they may work if the file system permissions are
set appropriately. Contact your system administrator if you get
messages like "permission denied".

Section 2: archive-delete, archive-stats (list administrators only)

The archive-delete option takes the usual arguments: dates,
message counts, message numbers, and combinations thereof
(as described for "archive-get", above). It can remove all
of the archives for a mailing list with one command, and a
message can be prevented from appearing in a digest by deleting
it, so use this mode with extreme caution.  

The numbers of the remaining messages are not changed. For example,
if message number 200008/2 were deleted,  200008/1 and 200008/3
would be the first two messages in the August 2000 archive.
Deleting a message causes the index and count files to be updated
automatically, so "archive-sync" is not needed after "archive-delete".

List owners can use the "archive-stats" command to get a sorted
report of the number of messages posted by each address to the named
list for the period of time specified by "filespec". For instance,
to find out who posted the most on mj2-dev during September 2000:
  archive-stats mj2-dev 200009

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Section 3: archive-sync (list admins with file system access only)

Only use "archive-sync" when you have manually edited a file
at the operating system level. You may also have to delete old
archive database files and strip special lines out of the archive
to make this work. For expert use only! Back up your directories
before attempting to use this option.

The archive-sync command takes one argument, which must be the
date of a particular archive file or a Majordomo filespec matching
one or more archive files (see "help filespecs").  For example,
  archive-sync mj2-dev 200005
would synchronize the May 2000 archive index and counts with the
messages themselves.

Alternately, if you have a bunch of files to process at once,
you can specify a pattern and all files matching that pattern
will be synchronized:
  archive-sync mj2-dev /19991?/
would synchronize the October, November, and December 1999 archives.

In the file system, all archive file names must begin with the list
name, and the list name should NOT be included in the "filespec" field.

When using archive-sync, any message without an X-Archive-Number 
header will be given a new number, one greater than the highest
number in the archive, and a new header.  Any archive number that
does not correspond to the archive in question will be replaced by
one that does (in this way, it is possible to combine archives).
