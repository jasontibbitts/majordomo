must specify exactly one of -check, -force, or -incvol
   -check,  if specified, pushes a digest if necessary
   -force,  if specified, pushes a digest needed or not
   -incvol, if specified, increments the volume number
digestname, if specified, is the name of a list digest
listname, required, is the name of a list at this site

NOTE: The "mkdigest" command causes "digest-force" to occur.

In all cases, leaving off the digestname operates on all of the
lists's digests. You must have list archives enabled to create digests.

digest-incvol listname digestname
  increments the volume number.  (Yes, you could do it with a configset as
  well, but this is nice to do from cron once a year.)

digest-check listname digestname
  checks to see if a digest should be pushed and pushes it if necessary.

digest-force listname digestname
  forces a digest push _now_, even if it doesn't have enough messages in it
  to go normally.  This is for people who want a digest to go at midnmight,
  regardless or whether or not it will be full.
