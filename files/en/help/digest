The digest command is used to cause messages to be bundled into digests
and delivered to subscribers who have a "digest" delivery mode (see
"help set" for a description of delivery modes).  Each mailing list can
support multiple digests, as determined by the "digests" configuration
setting (see "help configset_digests" for more details).  An
administrative password is usually required to issues the digest
command.

In the examples that follow, substitute the name of a valid mailing list
for LISTNAME.

If no command mode is used, a list of supported digests and their
descriptions will be displayed.  For example, the command

  digest LISTNAME

might display the following information for a mailing list that supports
"daily" and "weekly" digests:

  daily         Daily digest
  weekly        Weekly digest

If you know the name of a digest, you can see a list of messages waiting
to be delivered with the digest-status command.  For example, the
command:

  digest-status LISTNAME weekly

might display the following information:

  Digest Name                weekly
  Last delivered on          Mon Aug 14 21:15:06 2000
  Age of oldest message      407014 seconds
  Oldest age allowed         518400 seconds
  Age of newest message      2402 seconds
  Messages awaiting delivery 194
  Message total size         2006561 bytes
  Maximum size of a digest   102400 bytes
  200008/660     On the road to a PGM panic...........
   by "THC" <thchi@xxxxxxx.xx.jp>                      Mon Aug 14 23:15:20 2000
   (summaries of the other 193 messages have been omitted)

Although the last example only applied to the "weekly" digest, it is
possible to apply the digest command to every digest supported by a
mailing list.  To do this, either omit the digest name entirely, or use
the "ALL" keyword.  The following two commands are identical:

  digest-status LISTNAME
  digest-status LISTNAME ALL

To apply the digest command to more than one digest, use commas to 
separate the names.  For example:

  digest-status LISTNAME daily,weekly

  
The check, force, and repeat command modes
------------------------------------------
Digests are usually delivered automatically, based upon the constraints
in the "digests" configuration setting.  However, it is also possible to
cause digests to be delivered with the digest-check and digest-force
commands.

The digest-check command examines the rules in the "digests"
configuration setting, and causes a digest to be delivered if it meets
the time constraints.  For example, the command:

  digest-check LISTNAME weekly

would cause one issue of the "weekly" digest to be delivered if the
constraints are met.  To deliver several issues with one command, it is
also necessary to use the "repeat" command mode, e.g.,

  digest-check-repeat LISTNAME weekly

In "check" mode the "separate" field in the "digests" configuration setting, 
which specifies the minimum time between digests, must be set to 0 or
some other small number for more than one digest to be issued.

To override the "separate" field and other time constraints, use the
"force" command mode instead of the "check" command mode.  For example,

  digest-force LISTNAME daily

would force one issue of the "daily" digest to be delivered.  To force
multiple issues to be delivered, use "repeat" mode, for example:

  digest-force-repeat LISTNAME daily


The incvol command mode
-----------------------
Each digest has a volume and issue number.  Whenever a digest is
delivered, the issue number is increased by one automatically.  There
are two ways to increase the volume number.  One way is to change
the "digest_issues" configuration setting with the configset command.  
The other way is to use the "digest-incvol" command.  For example,
if the "daily" digest is delivering issues for volume number 3, the
command:

  digest-incvol LISTNAME daily

will increase the volume number to 4.

The "triggers" configuration setting can be used to issue the
digest-incvol command periodically if the command is stored in a file.
See "help configset_triggers" for more details.


Changing the appearance of digests
----------------------------------

There are three digest formats:  index, mime, and text.
Each digest consists of the following sections:

  * An optional preindex, which usually shows the digest name, 
    volume, and issue number.

  * An index, the contents of which are determined by the
    digest_index_format configuration setting, and which
    can be overridden on a digest-by-digest basis by the digests
    configuration setting.

  * An optional postindex.

  * The e-mail messages (absent in "index" format digests).

  * An optional footer (absent in "index" format digests).

The preindex, postindex, and footer can be customized using the put
command.  The customizations can be specific to a particular digest
name, such as the "weekly" digest; to a specific format, such as the
"mime" format; or to every digest.  When Majordomo determines which
customizations to use, it searches for files in the following order:

  digest_NAME_FORMAT_FILE
  digest_NAME_FILE
  digest_FORMAT_FILE
  digest_FILE

For example, if your mailing list has a digest called "weekly" and a 
"mime" format digest is being delivered, Majordomo will look for the following 
files for the postindex:

  digest_weekly_mime_postindex
  digest_weekly_postindex
  digest_mime_postindex
  digest_postindex

As an example, you might want to indicate in the postindex of "text"
format digests that all of the message attachments have been omitted.
The following command would accomplish that:

put LISTNAME /digest_text_postindex  Text postindex <<LMN
  All of the messages in this digest are presented in plain text.
  Any attachments that may have accompanied the original messages
  have been thrown away.
LMN

Please see "help get" and "help put" for more information on retrieving
and replacing files.

Each preindex, postindex, and footer file supports variable
substitutions.  Please see the digest_preindex description in 
"help reply_files" for a list of the supported substitutions.

Digest headers
--------------
The mail headers that appear in a digest are configurable, according
to the following table.

  Header                Configuration Setting

  Errors-To             sender
  From                  whoami_owner
  Precedence            precedence
  Reply-To              reply_to
  Sender                sender
  Subject               digests
  To                    whoami

In addition, any headers from the message_headers setting will also be
added to each digest.

A list must have an archive in order to create digests (see 
"help configset_archive_dir" for more details).
