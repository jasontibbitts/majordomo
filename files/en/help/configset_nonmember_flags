EXAMPLE:
configset listname nonmember_flags = A


A string containing the flags which apply to users who are not list members
when they send messages to the list.  Only acknowledgement flags and the
postblock flag make sense in this case.  They are:
  b - ackstall
  d - ackdeny
  f - ackpost
  j - ackreject
  O - postblock
