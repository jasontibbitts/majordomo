The newintro command will replace the contents of the "/intro" file
that is displayed by the intro command.

The new contents of the intro file must be included in a here document
(see "help here_document" for more details).  For example, the
following command would replace the contents of the intro file with
the sentence "Hello, subscriber!":

newintro LISTNAME <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

The newintro command is a convenient way to use the put command.  For
example, the following use of the put command is identical to the
newintro command in the previous example.

put LISTNAME /intro List Introductory Information <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

By default, an administrative password is required to use the newintro
command.  The access restrictions for the put command (as determined
by the access_rules configuration setting) also apply to the newintro
command.
