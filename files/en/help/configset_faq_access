EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL faq_access = open

$INCLUDE-config/faq_access

This setting determines who can use the faq command to retrieve
the Frequently Asked Questions document for a list.  The FAQ normally 
resides in a list's private file space, and therefore can also be 
accessed by the get and index commands, but only by list administrators. 

If an FAQ document does not exist for the list, the faq command
will cause a default document to be retrieved from the DEFAULT or 
GLOBAL pseudo-list, or from the stock files supplied by Majordomo.

An administrative password can be used to issue the faq command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the faq command 
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
