This file contains all commands (or requests) which can be controlled
through 'configset access_rules', and also shows which variables can
be tested, set, and unset while handling those requests. Please refer
to "help configset access_rules" for full syntax.

There are three sections below:
 - the requests which can be processed
 - the variables available for each request
 - an explanation of each variable
