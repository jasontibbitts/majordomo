This file contains all commands (or requests) which can be controlled
through 'configset access_rules', and also shows which variables can
be tested, set, and unset while handling those requests. Please refer
to "help configset access_rules" for full syntax.

This file does NOT contain ANY file substitution variables, which
cause new strings to be inserted in files as they are used to
generate messages for the user (for that kind of variable, see
"help variables").

There are three sections below:
 - the requests which can be processed
 - the variables available for each request
 - an explanation of each variable
