EXAMPLE:
configset listname archive_size = 100k


$INCLUDE-config/archive_size

If the archive size is unlimited, each archive file will include the
list name, followed by a period and date, as determined by the
archive_split configuration setting.  For example, the June 2001 archive
of the potato mailing list might have the following file name:
  potato.200106

If the archive size is limited, the name of each file will be followed
by a hyphen and two digits.  For example, if the potato list has a 50
message limit, the August 2001 messages might be split into three
archives:
  potato.200108-00
  potato.200108-01
  potato.200108-02
