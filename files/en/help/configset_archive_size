EXAMPLE:
configset listname archive_size = unlimited


A string decribing the maximum size of a single archive file.  When a
message arrives that would cause an archive file to exceed the size set
here, a new archive file is created with the final number incremented by
one.

Possible values are an integer followed by one of k, or m for
kilobytes or messages.  The value 'unlimited' is also permitted, in
which case the archives will not have the following period and two
digits appended.

Note that changing this variable will only change the settings for new
messages; old archives will not be renamed or altered in any way.
