# archive_size
# (unlimited)          [string] <archive>
# A string decribing the maximum size of a single archive file.  When a
# message arrives that would cause an archive file to exceed the size set
# here, a new archive file is created with the final number incremented by
# one.
#
# Possible values are an integer followed by one of k, or m for
# kilobytes or messages.  The value 'unlimited' is also permitted, in
# which case the archives will not have the following period and two
# digits appended.
#
# Note that changing this variable will only change the settings for new
# messages; old archives will not be renamed or altered in any way.
