The owner command is used only in the access_rules configuration
setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. 

The owner command allows list managers to restrict e-mail messages which
are sent to the owners or moderators of a mailing list.  For example, a
manager could create an auxiliary list, badguys, and use this
access_rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
owner
deny, reason="This address has been blacklisted."
@badguys
ENDTAG

Alternatively, the banned users could be listed in the rule, for
example:

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
owner
deny, reason="This address has been blacklisted."
/joe\@example.com/i OR /jane\@example.com/i
ENDTAG

The following actions are supported for the "owner" command in the
access_rules setting:  allow, deny, mailfile, reason, reply, and
replyfile.  

When access is denied, a reply message is not usually sent to the person
who was denied access.  Instead, any explanations given by reason,
reply, or replyfile actions in the access rules will be added to the
"inform" message that is sent to the list administrators, if the
"inform" setting is configured to send notices when the owner command
fails.

The "mailfile" action can be used to send a message to the address 
that was denied access.  For example, the following rule would send
the "/access_blocked" file to anyone in the "badguys" sublist who
sends a message to the administrators.

owner
mailfile=/access_blocked
@badguys

By default, the message will be sent to the list owners or moderators.

Access checks for the owner command take place after the message is
checked by the bounce rules.  See "help configset_bounce_rules" for more
information.
