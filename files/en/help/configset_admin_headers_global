addendum to Majordomo2 "configset admin_header" File - updated 25 Jan 99

NOTE: For help on admin_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers.
