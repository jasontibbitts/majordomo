In both cases, the welcome_files configuration setting determines which
documents are displayed in the welcome message.

It is possible to override the value of this setting from the command
line.  If this setting is turned off, the "register-welcome" or
"subscribe-welcome" command will cause the welcome message to be sent.
If this setting is turned on, the "register-nowelcome" or
"subscribe-nowelcome" command will prevent the welcome message from
being sent.
