EXAMPLE:
configset listname who_access = open

$INCLUDE-config/who_access

This setting determines who can use the who command to see 
the addresses that are subscribed to a mailing list.  In
the case of the GLOBAL pseudo-list, it restricts access to
the central registry for a domain.

An administrative password can be used to issue the who command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the who command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
