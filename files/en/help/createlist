The createlist command is used to build or destroy an electronic
mailing list.  The simplest uses of this command are

  createlist LISTNAME OWNER

to build a list, and

  createlist-destroy LISTNAME

to destroy it, where LISTNAME is a valid list name, and OWNER is the
e-mail address of the person who will be managing the mailing list.  

A site or domain password is usually required to use this command (see
"help admin_passwords" for more information about administrative
passwords).

A mailing list name can consist of small or capital letters from the
English alphabet, digits, periods (.), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
Majordomo will treat small and capital letters in list names
identically, so "BigDeal" and "bigdeal" are names for the same mailing
list.

A new list can be assigned more than one list owner with a here
document, in which each list owner's address is placed on a separate
line.  For example, the following command...

createlist broccoli <<ABC
cabbage@example.com
kale@example.net
ABC

...would create the "broccoli" mailing list with two list owners.  See
"help here_document" for a discussion of multi-line commands.

The new_list file is sent to the list owners when a new list is
created, unless the "-nowelcome" mode was specified. If you want to change
this message, use the following command:
  get-edit GLOBAL /new_list

The createlist command automatically creates an archive directory unless
"-noarchive" mode is specified. It also creates a master administrative
password randomly (see "help configset_master_password" for details on
changing this password).

The archive directory is used to store messages that have been posted to
a mailing list.  Majordomo cannot send messages bundled into digests
unless the archive directory exists (see "help configset_archive_dir"
for details on changing the location of the archive).  If the archive
directory is not created by the createlist command, it is possible to
create it later with the put-dir command (see "help put" for more
details).

The "createlist" command also does (or suggests) the necessary mail
transfer agent (MTA) configuration. For example, if sendmail is the MTA
in use, a set of sendmail aliases will be generated.  Consult the README
files in the Majordomo software for further details on several common
MTAs.

If "createlist-regen" is used, all other options and arguments are
ignored.  If Majordomo is maintaining your MTA configuration, the
aliases file will be updated by this command.  Otherwise, a complete
list of suggested MTA configurations for the site and each list is
displayed.  Running the createlist-regen command is required if the
aliases, debug, or sublists configuration settings for any list are
changed.

The command modes include the following:

  -destroy
    The createlist-destroy command removes a list by renaming the list's
    directory, including a generation number to prevent successive
    destructions of the same list from overwriting one another. The list
    must have no subscribers, to prevent inconsistencies in the registry,
    and is not actually deleted from the file system until someone with
    shell access goes in and deletes the files and the renamed directory
    by hand. It renames the list's directory to start with a comma and
    end with the deletion version number, as in ",test-list.0".

  -force:
    If the list already exists, the 'createlist' command will fail
    unless the 'force' argument is used.  Note that the owner address you
    enter when you force the list creation will replace any previous owner
    addresses associated with the list.

  -noarchive:
    This argument suppresses creation of the message archive directory.
    WITHOUT '-noarchive', the directory "listname/public/archive" is
    created (regardless of the "configset archive_dir" setting).

  -nocreate:
    This argument will cause 'createlist' to suggest the MTA
    configuration without actually creating the list; the command will not
    fail if the list already exists.

  -noheader:
    The instructional information that precedes the suggested
    MTA configuration info will not be displayed.

  -nowelcome:
  -quiet:
    No introductory mail will be sent to the list owner.
    (The 'quiet' and 'nowelcome' modes are identical.)

  -pass:
    The master password will be stated explicitly on the command line,
    instead of being generated randomly.  The password must be at least
    as long as required by the password_min_length configuration
    setting.

  -regen:
    The regen command mode will cause the mail aliases for every list
    within a domain to be regenerated.  In addition, every configuration
    file will be reparsed, and warnings will be displayed if any of the
    settings is incorrect.  The createlist-regen command is run
    automatically every time the software is upgraded.

  -rename:
    The createlist-rename command will change the name of a mailing
    list.  All subscription information, archive file names, and 
    mail aliases will be updated automatically.  It may be necessary
    to adjust the configuration settings and welcome message manually,
    to reflect the new list name.

NOTE: Auxiliary lists are not created by the createlist command.  
An auxiliary list is created by adding an address to it with the 
subscribe command, or by mentioning it in the access rules (see
"help auxiliary_list" for more details).
