listname,  required, is an email list at this site
owner,     required, is an email address for who will manage the list
-nocreate, if specified, shows suggested aliases but takes no action
-noheader, if specified, shortens the suggested aliases message
-force,    if specified, takes action even if list already exists
-quiet,    if specified, suppresses intro msg for new owner (default)
-regen,    if specified, re-generates the suggested MTA configurations

Creates the internal structures needed to maintain a list with the given
name, unless the "-nocreate" or "-regen" options are used or unless the
list already exists and the "-force" option is not used. Be sure to review
"help configset debug_flags" and "help set" - it is easier to set up the
default values correctly than it is to have each subscriber alter them.
Some items like replyfile specifications in "configset access_rules" may
not function properly if default_flags are set wrong.

The "createlist" command also suggests the necessary MTA configuration
if the MTA in use is supported -- for example, if sendmail is the MTA in
use, a set of sendmail aliases will be generated.  Note that Majordomo
does not (yet) handle configuring the MTA itself, although it generally
provides data which can simply be pasted into the necessary config file.

NOTE: As of 1/99, the owner-listname alias has a trailing comma which must
      be removed or the sendmail alias will not work.

If "listname" is 'GLOBAL', the setup for the site-wide Majordomo address
is given instead of the setup for a single list.

If "createlist-regen" is used, all other options and arguments are ignored.
A complete list of suggested MTA configurations for the site and each list
is displayed. This will be required after changing "configset debug".

Once created, a list can only be deleted from the operating system
shell prompt. Remove the directory associated with the list to delete
it, as there is no Majordomo command to delete a list.

Options include the following:

  -force:
    If the list already exists, the 'createlist' command will fail
    unless the 'force' argument is used.  Note that the owner address you
    enter when you force the list creation will replace any previous owner
    addresses associated with the list.

  -nocreate:
    This argument will cause 'createlist' to suggest the MTA
    configuration without actually creating the list; the command will not
    fail if the list already exists.

  -noheader:
    The instructional information that precedes the suggested
    MTA configuration info will not be displayed.

  -quiet:
    No introductory mail will be sent to the list owner.
    (Introductory mail is not currently implemented as of 1/99.)

  -regen:
    Display MTA configuration only, ignore all other options and args.
