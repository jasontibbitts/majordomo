EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/default_language

When error, format, or reply files are displayed, Majordomo will
look through a series of directories until it finds the appropriate
file.  By default, four locations are searched:
  1. The file space of your mailing list
  2. The "en" subdirectory of the file space of the DEFAULT pseudo-list
  3. The file space of the DEFAULT pseudo-list
  4. The "en" subdirectory of the "SITE" file space.

Changing this setting will change the order of the locations that are
searched.  For example, if this setting had the following value:

  de,en

the following locations would be searched instead:
  1. The file space of your mailing list
  2. The "de" subdirectory of the file space of the DEFAULT pseudo-list
  3. The "en" subdirectory of the file space of the DEFAULT pseudo-list
  4. The file space of the DEFAULT pseudo-list
  5. The "de" subdirectory of the "SITE" file space.
  6. The "en" subdirectory of the "SITE" file space.
