EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL whereami = example.org


$INCLUDE-config/whereami

Other configuration settings (bounce_recipients, moderator, moderators, 
owners, sender, whoami, whoami_owner) may contain e-mail addresses
without domain names, for example:
 
  configset mylist whoami = mylist

In this case, the contents of the whereami setting will be appended to
the e-mail address automatically.

The value of this setting is used in the EHLO/HELO command during conversations
between Majordomo and the message transport agent.

The whereami setting is also substituted for the \$WHEREAMI variable wherever
substitutions are used.  See "help variables" for more details.
