EXAMPLE:
configset listname description = my very fine list


This is a short description of the list, used in the short listing.
It should be no more than 50 characters in order to fit on the average
terminal.  If this is empty, the first line of 'description_long' is
used.  If both are empty, the string "(no description)" is used.
