The footer text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to the
message.  The variables supported include the standard substitutions,
plus ARCNO, ARCURL, DATE, HOST, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED,
and USER.  See "help variables" for more information.  If the
"rewritefrom" flag is set for the author of the message, the USER
substitution will contain the author's rewritten address.  See "help
set" for a description of the rewritefrom flag.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes on
a special significance if it is the first character on the line.  If it
is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and a blank
line is written out (allowing you to embed blank lines without the
server thinking you have started another footer). If the first character
is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-', the first '-'
is removed without changing anything else. If the second character is a
printing character, the leading '-' is left alone.  Leading white space
does not have to be escaped with a dash, but it can be if you wish.
This syntax applies only to the message_fronters and message_footers
settings.

For multipart/mixed messages, fronters appear as separate parts at the
beginning of the message.  Message fronters are never added to other
kinds of multipart messages.

Fronters are not added at all to single-part messages that are not of
type text/plain.  This avoids destroying the content of structured
messages.
