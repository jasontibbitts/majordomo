The footer text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to the
message.  The variables supported include the standard substitutions,
plus DATE, HOST, MSGNO, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED, and USER.
See "help variables" for more information.  If the "rewritefrom" flag is
set for the author of the message, the USER substitution will contain
the author's rewritten address.  See "help set" for a description of the
rewritefrom flag.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes on
a special significance if it is the first character on the line.  If it
is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and a blank
line is written out (allowing you to embed blank lines without the
server thinking you have started another footer). If the first character
is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-', the first '-'
is removed without changing anything else. If the second character is a
printing character, the leading '-' is left alone.  Leading white space
does not have to be escaped with a dash, but it can be if you wish.
This syntax applies only to the message_fronter and message_footer
settings.

For multipart/mixed messages, fronters appear as separate parts at the
beginning of the message.  Message fronters are never added to other
kinds of multipart messages.

Fronters are not added at all to single-part messages that are not of
type text/plain.  This avoids destroying the content of structured
messages.  

Note that the footers are themselves available in other documents as
the substitution variables FOOTER, RANDOM_FOOTER, and ALL_FOOTERS.
Also note that you can't substitute fronters or footers into your
footers, as this would lead to an endless loop and the destruction of
the planet, and that some of the substitutions (HOST, MSGNO, SENDER,
SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED, and USER) don't really make any sense
except in the context of a posted message.
