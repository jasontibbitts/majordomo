This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the footers given here.

The footer text will undergo variable substitution (and possibly
auto-inclusion of OTHER files) as it is added to the message.
See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which are supported.

Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
the content of structured messages.)

The frequency with which footers appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_footer_frequency".


See Also:
   help configset message_footer_frequency (for how often the footer is sent)
