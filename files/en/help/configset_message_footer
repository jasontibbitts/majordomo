This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the footers given here. The
frequency with which footers appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_footer_frequency".

The footer text will undergo variable substitution (and possibly
auto-inclusion of OTHER files) as it is added to the message.
See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which are supported.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes
on a special significance:
   To embed a blank line in the footer, put a '-' as the first
       and ONLY character on the line (as in the example above).
   To preserve whitespace at the beginning of a line, put a - on the
       line before the whitespace to be preserved
   To put a literal '-' at the beginning of a line, double it.
This syntax applies only to message_fronters and message_footers.

Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
the content of structured messages.)
