The footer text will undergo variable substitution as it is added
to the message.  The variables supported include the standard substitutions,
plus ARCHIVE, ARCURL, DATE, HOST, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED, and 
USER.  See "help variables" for more information.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes on
a special significance if it is the first character on the line.  If it
is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and a blank
line is written out (allowing you to imbed blank lines without the
server thinking you have started another footer). If the first character
is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-', the first '-'
is removed without changing anything else. If the second character is a
printing character, the leading '-' is left alone. Note that leading
white space does NOT have to be escaped with a dash, but it can be if
you wish. This syntax applies only to message_fronters and
message_footers.

Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
part messages that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
the content of structured messages.)
