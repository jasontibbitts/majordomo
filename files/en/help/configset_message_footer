# message_footer
# (empty)              [string_2darray] <resend,digest>
# This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to
# the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers
# here by separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be
# added, it is chosen at random from the footers given here.
#
# The following strings can be placed in footers; they well be
# converted to the appropriate text when the footer is inserted into
# the message:
#
#   \$LIST    - the name of the list
#   \$VERSION - the version of Majordomo
#   \$SENDER  - the person who sent the message
#
# Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
# the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
# part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
# the content of structured messages.)
#
# The frequency with which footers appear can be controlled with the
# variable "message_footer_frequency".
