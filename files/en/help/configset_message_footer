This contains blocks of text, called footers, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple footers
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a footer is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the footers given here. The
frequency with which footers appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_footer_frequency".

The footer text will undergo variable substitution as it is added
to the message.  The variables supported include the standard substitutions,
plus ARCHIVE, ARCURL, DATE, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED, and USER.
See "help variables" for more information.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes
on a special significance if it is the first character on the line.
If it is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and
a blank line is written out (allowing you to imbed blank lines without
the server thinking you have started another footer). If the first
character is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-',
the first '-' is removed without changing anything else. If the
second character is a printing character, the leading '-' is left
alone. Note that leading white space does NOT have to be escaped
with a dash, but it can be if you wish. This syntax applies only
to message_fronters and message_footers.

Note that for multipart messages, footers appear as separate parts at
the end of the message and that footers are not added at all to single
part messages that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids destroying
the content of structured messages.)
