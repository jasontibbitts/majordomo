The "help patterns" document explains how to write Majordomo patterns.
In addition to pattern matching, the noarchive_headers setting supports
special features, such as severity scores and customized access
variables.  The "help configset_admin_body" document explains how to use
these features. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers. Just substitute the string "noarchive_"
wherever you see "admin_" in that help file.

See "help configset_access_rules" for how to send informative messages
when one of the noarchive_headers lines matches.

The admin_body, admin_headers, noarchive_body, noarchive_headers,
taboo_body, and taboo_headers settings have a special characteristic.
When these six settings are applied to a message that has been posted to
a mailing list, the patterns in the GLOBAL settings are also used.
