Section 1 - Introduction to "help overview"

Below are many techniques a list subscriber may want to use, but
some commands and many options are left out. For a complete set of all
subscriber commands, send "help commands" to $MJ
(or send "help topics" for a list of all possible commands)

To get top-level help, send "help" on a line by itself to the server.
To get a description of command syntax, send "help commands".

This file is specific to list subscribers! To get suggestions from an
administrator or list owner perspective  send "help admin commands"
or "help admin" to the server.

Here are the main sections below:
  Section 2 - Where to Send Email (or "don't bug the wrong person")
  Section 3 - Subscribing and Unsubscribing (without the owner's help)
  Section 4 - Getting Information (about lists and about the server)

If you have suggestions or corrections for this or other help files,
please contact the maintainer as indicated at the end of this message.

Section 2 - Where to Send Email (or "don't bug the wrong person")

All Majordomo2 commands are sent to the server at $MJ
(this includes things like "subscribe", "help", "lists", etc)
If you have shell access, refer to "help mj_shell" for an
alternative to sending email to the server.

To send a post (also called a broadcast) to an email list called
"LISTNAME", just send email to LISTNAME@$WHEREAMI
(of course "LISTNAME" is replaced with the actual name of the list)


<> DO NOT SEND MAJORDOMO COMMANDS TO THE EMAIL LIST ITSELF!
<> Go back and read the two paragraphs above if you have any questions.


To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
owner address, which is formed by adding "-owner" to the list name.
For instance, to contact the list owner for the list "LISTNAME",
you would send email to LISTNAME-owner@$WHEREAMI

A human site administrator should be available at $MJOWNER
but don't expect the overall admin to answer questions in detail!
(save this address for when a list owner can't help you...)

NOTE: This section is replicated in "help admin".

Section 3 - Subscribing and Unsubscribing (without the owner's help)

For full details, send this six-line message to $MJ
   help register
   help unregister
   help subscribe
   help unsubscribe
   help accept
   help password


Subscribing To a List
---------------------

  Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
  this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
  list, so you can begin receiving mailings. You don't need to involve the
  list owner in this process (usually), and doing it yourself will save
  them LOTS of time. Remember a list owner is normally a volunteer with
  other things to do and lots of people subscribed to one or more lists.

  To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
  simply send a "subscribe" command to the server as detailed in the help
  file for "subscribe". To get that file, send this one line to $MJ
   help subscribe
  You supply at least the list's name, and you can supply your real name
  and email address if it is not in your email headers.

  Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be
  added to the mailing list immediately, or you may receive notification
  that an authorization key (or token) is required for subscription.
  This can be a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being
  swamped in extra email by someone who forged requests from your address.
  In this case, follow the instructions in the help file for "accept".
  (Or send a "reject" command if you don't want to be subscribed.)

  You may also get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to
  the list owner for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies
  about who may subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the
  list owner may contact you soon after your request, or the list owner may
  simply add you to the list when they have time.

  Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
  list policies and features.  Please SAVE THIS MESSAGE for future
  reference; it should contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If
  you lose the intro mail and would like another copy of the policies,
  send this one-line message to $MJ
       intro LISTNAME
  ...substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "LISTNAME".

  It is possible for a list owner to configure the list so it sends no
  files or many files to new subscribers. There can be an "intro" file,
  an "info" file, a "faq" file, and other messages. If you find that you
  get too much or too little information, or you don't know how to get
  another copy after you lose it, contact the list owner as indicated
  below (using the special "-owner" email address that all lists have).


Unsubscribing From Mailing LIsts
--------------------------------

  Your original intro message should contains the exact command for
  removing your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
  may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:
       unsubscribe LISTNAME
  (This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
  return address is shown in your mail headers.)

  To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending the
  request, refer to the help file for "unsubscribe" to get details on
  how to remove yourself. If you have your old password, you can quickly
  remove your old address even if you no longer have access to the
  account. If your old account is forwarding mail to your new account,
  you can also use "accept" from the new account once the server asks
  you for confirmation.

  If you want to unsubscribe from all lists on this server at once,
  send an "unregister" command instead of "unsubscribe". This will
  remove you from all email lists reachable from $MJ

Section 4 - Getting Information (about lists and about the server)

  For full details, send this eight-line message to $MJ
   help help
   help lists
   help info
   help intro
   help faq
   help index
   help get
   help show

  To get help on any subject, try sending "help XXXX" to the server,
  where "XXXX" is replaced by the command you need information on.
  If you did not pick a subject for which there is a specific help
  file, just send "help" on a line by itself. The default help file
  will point you to other help files, and you can usually find the
  right help subject in one or two more tries.

  To get a list of lists on this system that are available to you,
  send the following one-line message to $MJ
       lists
  You will receive a reply contain the names of the mailing lists
  and a brief description of each list. You can get more or less
  detail by adding options to the command - see the "lists" help file.

  To get more information about a particular list, use several commands
  to get files associated with the list. For example, if the name of
  the list about which you wish information is "LISTNAME", you could
  put one or more of these commands in a message to $MJ
       info  LISTNAME
       intro LISTNAME
       faq   LISTNAME
       index LISTNAME
  You will get back information, an introduction, and a FAQ (which
  stands for Frequently Asked Questions) assuming the list owner has
  configured the list to contain all these files. The "index" command
  will show you if the list owner has made OTHER files available for
  you to get with the "get" command. (Note that sending "faq LISTNAME"
  is identical to sending "get LISTNAME faq" to the server, etc.)

  To find out more about your subscription, use the "show" command
  as detailed by "help show".

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
