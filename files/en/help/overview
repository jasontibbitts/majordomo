                 An Overview of Majordomo 2, version $VERSION

This help message is from the Majordomo list management software at
  $SITE
You interact with the Majordomo software by sending commands to
  $MJ
in the body of a mail message. Please do not put your commands in
the subject! Majordomo only processes commands in the message body.

Majordomo is designed to automatically manage electronic mailing lists.
This document presents an overview of how Majordomo works, from the
perspective of someone who wants to participate in a mailing list.
If you are looking for an overview from the perspective of a list
administrator, use the "help admin" command.

This document describes many of the common commands, but some features
are not mentioned here.  To see a complete list of subscriber commands, 
use the "help commands" command.  To see a complete list of all
Majordomo commands, use the "help topics" command.

Important E-mail Addresses
--------------------------

This Majordomo server is running at the domain "$WHEREAMI".
There are two important addresses that pertain to every
mailing list at this domain

$MJ

  This is the list server address, the address to which 
  Majordomo commands (such as "subscribe," "help," or "lists")
  should ALWAYS be sent.  Mail sent to this address is processed
  automatically; do not expect a human being ever to read it.

$MJOWNER

  This is the address of the person or persons who administrate the 
  entire domain.  Write to this address in case of an emergency,
  such as a mail loop or system failure.

In addition, there are two important addresses for every mailing
list supported by this domain.  Replace LISTNAME with the actual
name of a mailing list at this domain.

LISTNAME@$WHEREAMI

  This is the address to which you should post messages, once
  you have subscribed to a mailing list.  Posted messages may
  be read by hundreds or thousands of people, so use discretion.
  NEVER send Majordomo commands to this address.

LISTNAME-owner@$WHEREAMI

  This is the address of the person or persons who maintain the
  mailing list.  If you have private questions that are specific to a
  particular mailing list, write to the owners at this address.

Which Mailing Lists are Served at $WHEREAMI?
--------------------------------------------

To see a list of public mailing lists at this domain, with brief
descriptions of each list, use the command
  lists

If you would like to see more details, such as the number of subscribers 
and how often messages are posted, use this command instead:
  lists-full

There are three documents associated with each mailing list, 
the frequently asked questions (faq) document, the info document,
and the intro document.  To obtain these documents for a specific
list, use the following commands:
  faq LISTNAME
  info LISTNAME
  intro LISTNAME

Subscribing to a List
---------------------

  Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
  this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
  list, so you can begin receiving mailings. You don't need to involve the
  list owner in this process (usually), and doing it yourself will save
  them LOTS of time. Remember a list owner is normally a volunteer with
  other things to do and lots of people subscribed to one or more lists.

  To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
  simply send a "subscribe" command to the server as detailed in the help
  file for "subscribe". To get that file, send this one line to $MJ
   help subscribe
  You supply at least the list's name, and you can supply your real name
  and email address if it is not in your email headers.

  Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be
  added to the mailing list immediately, or you may receive notification
  that an authorization key (or token) is required for subscription.
  This can be a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being
  swamped in extra email by someone who forged requests from your address.
  In this case, follow the instructions in the help file for "accept".
  (Or send a "reject" command if you don't want to be subscribed.)

  You may also get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to
  the list owner for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies
  about who may subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the
  list owner may contact you soon after your request, or the list owner may
  simply add you to the list when they have time.

  Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
  list policies and features.  Please SAVE THIS MESSAGE for future
  reference; it should contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If
  you lose the intro mail and would like another copy of the policies,
  send this one-line message to $MJ
       intro LISTNAME
  ...substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "LISTNAME".

  It is possible for a list owner to configure the list so it sends no
  files or many files to new subscribers. There can be an "intro" file,
  an "info" file, a "faq" file, and other messages. If you find that you
  get too much or too little information, or you don't know how to get
  another copy after you lose it, contact the list owner as indicated
  below (using the special "-owner" email address that all lists have).

Your Personal Password
----------------------



Unsubscribing from Mailing Lists
--------------------------------

  Your original intro message should contains the exact command for
  removing your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
  may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:
       unsubscribe LISTNAME
  (This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
  return address is shown in your mail headers.)

  To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending the
  request, refer to the help file for "unsubscribe" to get details on
  how to remove yourself. If you have your old password, you can quickly
  remove your old address even if you no longer have access to the
  account. If your old account is forwarding mail to your new account,
  you can also use "accept" from the new account once the server asks
  you for confirmation.

  If you want to unsubscribe from all lists on this server at once,
  send an "unregister" command instead of "unsubscribe". This will
  remove you from all email lists reachable from $MJ
