EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL addr_allow_at_in_phrase = no


$INCLUDE-config/addr_allow_at_in_phrase

Normally, the '@' symbol is only allowed to separate the local part
and domain of an address.  Any addresses with '@' symbols in the
phrase (the "comment" portion of the address) are invalid.  For
example, the following address would be invalid:

  "J.Q. Someone @ work" <someone@example.com>

Changing this setting to "yes" would make the address in the previous
example valid.
