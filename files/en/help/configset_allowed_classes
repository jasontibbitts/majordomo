EXAMPLE:
configset listname allowed_classes << ENDTAG
each
nomail
ENDTAG


A list of the classes that a user is allowed to put themselves into.
If a less specific class like 'digest' is given, users are allowed
to put themselves into any of the more specific classes.

Subscription class can be changed by the "set" command. Available
classes are each, digest, nomail. By default, a user is free to
choose any of these three classes. The example above prohibits the
user from choosing to receive digests.
