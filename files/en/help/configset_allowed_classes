$INCLUDE-config/allowed_classes

There are five useful classes (digest, each, mail, nomail, unique) and
one class which is only used for diagnostic purposes (all) supported by
this setting.  See "help set" for a description of each class.

This setting has no effect if an administrative password is used.
Administrators can always choose any delivery class.

If a class, like "digest", which has subclasses is allowed, subscribers
are allowed to put themselves into any of the more specific classes (for
example, "digest-daily" or "digest-weekly"). 

This setting is useful for list administrators who wish to restrict
the choices of their subscribers.  For example, if you wish all subscribers 
to receive a customized digest, list only the "digest" and "nomail"
classes.
