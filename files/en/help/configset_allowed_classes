EXAMPLE:
configset listname allowed_classes << ENDTAG
each
nomail
ENDTAG


A list of the classes that a user is allowed to put themselves into.
If a less specific class like 'digest' is given, users are allowed
to put themselves into any of the more specific classes.

Available classes are each, digest, nomail.

Subscription class can be changed by the "set" command. By default,
a user is free to choose any of these three classes. The example
above prohibits the user from choosing to receive digests.
