A list of the classes that a user is allowed to put themselves into.
There are currently four classes (each, unique, digest, nomail), and
the digest class may have list-owner-defined subclasses.  (There is
actually a fifth class, "all", which should only be used by the list
owner as described in "help set".)

To enable all available classes, list all four of them.

If a class (like 'digest') which has sub-classes is allowed, users
are allowed to put themselves into any of the more specific classes
(like 'digest-daily' or digest-weekly'). Unless 'each' or 'unique'
is allowed, the owner can force users to stay in 'digest' or 'nomail'
mode, thus lowering the load on the server.

The subscription class can be changed with the "set" command. By
default, a user is free to choose any of these four classes. The
example above prohibits the user from choosing to receive digests but
does allow them to suspend their subscription with 'nomail'.

To suspend cross-list duplicate post checking, do not allow the
"unique" class of subscriptions. Refer to "help configset dup_lifetime"
and "help set" for more details.
