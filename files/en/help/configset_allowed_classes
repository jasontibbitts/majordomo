EXAMPLE:
configset listname allowed_classes << ENDTAG
each
nomail
ENDTAG


A list of the classes that a user is allowed to put themselves into.
There are currently three classes (each, digest, nomail), and the
digest class may have list-owner-defined subclasses.

To enable all available classes, list all three of them. There is a
class called "all", but it should only be used by the list owner as
described in "help set".

If a class (like 'digest') which has sub-classes is allowed, users
are allowed to put themselves into any of the more specific classes
(like 'digest-daily' or digest-weekly'). Unless 'each' is allowed,
the owner can force users to stay in 'digest' or 'nomail' mode,
thus lowering the load on the server.

Subscription class can be changed by the "set" command. By default,
a user is free to choose any of these three classes. The example
above prohibits the user from choosing to receive digests but does
allow them to suspend their subscription with 'nomail'.
