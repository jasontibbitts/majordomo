The password command is used to change or display the personal password
for an e-mail address that has been registered at this domain.  If this
command succeeds, the password will be sent to the address in a separate
message.  

This command has no influence on administrative passwords.
(See "help admin_passwords" for more details.)

There are three ways to use the password command.  

First, you can specify a new password that will replace the old one.
The new password must be at least $PWLENGTH characters long.  For
example, the following command would change your personal password to
"34SA98BZAZ4M":

  password 34SA98BZAZ4M

Second, you can ask Majordomo to create a new password for you randomly
with the following command:

  password-gen

Finally, you can see your existing password with the following command:

  password-show
  
If you do not have a personal password, you can obtain one by
registering (with the register command) or by subscribing to a mailing
list (with the subscribe command, which will register your address
automatically).  The personal password is usually displayed in the
welcome message that new subscribers receive when they join a mailing
list.  Your e-mail address will never have more than one personal
password, regardless of the number of subscriptions.  

Attempting to see or change the password of an address that has not been
registered will result in an error.

Personal passwords must be used with the "approve" command or in the
"default password" command.  See "help approve" and "help default" for
more details.

The primary use of your personal passwords is to avoid the need to
confirm commands that affect your subscriptions.  For example, the
following command:

  approve YOURPASSWORD set LISTNAME digest

will allow you to change to the "digest" delivery class for the LISTNAME
mailing list without confirmation.  (Substitute your personal password
for YOURPASSWORD.)

Another important use of your personal password is to allow you to
unregister an old address when you no longer have the ability to post
messages from that address.  The following command will work when sent
from any e-mail address:

  approve OLDPASSWORD unregister OLDADDRESS

(Substitute your old password for OLDPASSWORD and your old address for
OLDADDRESS.)

It is necessary to use a personal password to unsubscribe or change
subscription settings with the WWW interface for subscribers.
See "help mj_wwwusr" for more details.


                        Note for Administrators

The "new_password" reply file is usually mailed to the address of the
person whose password is affected by the command.  If a new password is
specified on the command line, and the "quiet" command mode is used, the
reply file will not be mailed.  See "help reply_files" for more details
on reply files.
