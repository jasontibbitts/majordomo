The password command is used to change the personal password for an
address that has already been registered.  This command has no
influence on administrative passwords (see "help admin_passwords"
for more details).

Each address that has been registered (with the register command, or by
subscribing to a mailing list with the subscribe command) at a domain
will have exactly one personal password, regardless of the number of
subscriptions.  The personal password is usually displayed in the
welcome message that new subscribers receive when they join a mailing
list.

The primary use of personal passwords is to authorize changes in
subscriptions when an old e-mail address is inaccessible. 
For example, this command:

  approve MYPASSWORD unsubscribe LISTNAME oldaddress@example.com

could be used by anyone to remove oldaddress@example.com from the 
LISTNAME mailing list.  Personal passwords also allow subscribers to
avoid having to confirm new subscriptions.  Also, it is necessary to 
use a personal password to unsubscribe or change subscription settings
with the WWW interface for subscribers.
