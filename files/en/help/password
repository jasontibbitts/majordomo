NOTE: This command applies to PERSONAL PASSWORDS only! List owners
      and site managers should refer to "help configset master_password"
      and "help configset passwords" for other password options.

Passwords supplied by the "password" command are used only for bypassing
confirmations on commands like subscribe, not for configuring lists.
A confirmation token will be sent to the given "address" to verify
this action, and must be replied to with an "accept" command before
the password will be changed.

You may either use the "-random" option OR use "newpassword", not both.

The "-random" option will generate a random password. No "newpassword"
may be provided in this case since Majordomo will invent one and send
it to "address" with a request for confirmation.

If "newpassword" is provided this command changes the password for
the given registered "address" to "newpassword".

An address can be registered with the "register" command, or the
registration will be done automatically whenever a previously
unregistered address is subscribed to any list at this site.
When you register before subscribing, you will receive a password.

The primary use of personal passwords is to authorize changes in
subscriptions when the subscribed account is unavailable. Having a
password allows you to unsubscribe yourself without access to the
account you subscribed from, For example:
  approve MYOWNPASSWORD unsubscribe LISTNAME me@nowhere.com
Remember to use your real password and a real list name. With the
password, you do not have to send this command from the subscribed
account, and no "accept" confirmation will be required.
