The information in the log is made available through the report command.
See "help report" for more details.

The old log entries are removed periodically, as indicated by the "log" 
trigger in the triggers configuration setting of the GLOBAL pseudo-list.

The log is kept in the "_log" file, in the main directory of the GLOBAL
pseudo-list.  Using a large value for the log_lifetime setting can cause
this file to become large.  It also will cause the report command to run
more slowly.
