EXAMPLE:
configset listname sequence_number = 101


This is the sequence number used to number messages which pass through
the list.  It is automatically incremented by one for each message. 
It may be manually set here, but watch out for apparently duplicate
messages if you set up your headers so your subscribers can track
the number (useful to debug sporadic delivery, etc).
