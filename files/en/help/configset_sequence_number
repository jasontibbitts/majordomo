$INCLUDE-config/sequence_number

The sequence number is available in some places through the SEQNO
substitution variable.  This substitution is available to the
message_footer, message_fronter, message_headers, reply_to, and
subject_prefix configuration settings.   It is also available to the
ack_archive and ack_success reply files.  See "help variables" for an
introduction to substitutions.  

An "X-Sequence-Number" header is added to every message that is stored
in the archive of the mailing list.

When the "who-bounce" command or the "show" command lists the numbers of
messages that have bounced, it is reporting the sequence numbers of
messages that could not be delivered.
