EXAMPLE:
configset listname sequence_number = 101


This is the sequence number used to number messages which pass through
the list.  It is automatically incremented by one for each message. 
It may be manually set here, but watch out for apparently duplicate
messages if you configure the headers of posted messages to display
the sequence number.

One advantage of displaying the sequence number in the headers is
that it will become clear to subscribers if some messages have
not been delivered to them.  It is possible for subscribers to
obtain a new copy of posted messages using the archive command
