NOTE: This help file is for the command called "default". To get
      basic help, just send "help" to the server (not "help default").

WARNING: This command is not implemented in mj_shell, it is available
         ONLY when sending commands via email.

The 'default' command sets certain defaults used by the command parser
for processing one or more commands. The more commands you have, the
more "default" helps you. It is most often used by list owners and
administrators, but can also be used by subscribers.

This is not a general variable mechanism, it is ONLY for providing
the listed values. If the value is omitted, the default setting is
removed. This allows you to have a default for some commands but
not for others.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following defaults can be set, as explained below:

 1. language:  (Not implemented.) Sets the default language preference
               list to the comma-separated list of two-letter language
               abbreviations.

 2. list:      Sets the default list for commands to the provided list.
               To clear the default list, don't supply one.

 3. password:  Approves all following commands with the given password.
               To clear the password, don't supply one.

 4. prefix:    (Not implemented.) Sets a prefix that (if present) will be
               deleted from the beginning of all following lines.

 5. user:      Replaces the address found in the "From:" field of your
               email headers.

Section 1: default language XX

  Not implemented!

The 'language' command (not implemented) is equivalent to the 'default
language' command, and is supplied for the benefit of those who do not
wish to see server messages in English.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section 2: default list LISTNAME

Setting a default list makes the list an optional argument for all
commands which take one (excepting the createlist command). To clear
the default list for additional commands, don't supply one.

Note that this is not without ambiguity, as the parser cannot always
tell when the default list is implied.  When running at the -request
address, the parser generally starts with a default list in place.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section 3: default password STRING

Setting a default password will implicitly do the equivalent of
'approve password' at the beginning of each following command.

List subscribers will find little use for "default", except that
it can make command lines shorter.

List administrators will find it especially useful when returning
the output of a 'configshow' command to the parser to change some
variables; simply add the 'default password' command to the beginning
of the message or file, and the parser will accept the 'configset'
commands exactly as dumped by the configshow command.

Defaulting a password make it much simpler to submit multiple
commands to the parser in one fell swoop.  For example, it makes
the following sets of commands equivalent:
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com
or:
    default password MYPASSWORD
    subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section 4: default prefix STRING

  Not implemented!

Sets a prefix that (if present) will be DELETED, not ADDED, from the
beginning of all following lines before the commands are processed.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Section 5: default user ADDRESS

ADDRESS is a regular email address, optionally containing comments.
For example:
  joe@blow.com
  Joe Blow <joe@blow.com>
  joe@blow.com (Joe Blow)

When a "default user" command is in effect, any command that looks
at your headers to see who sent the command will behave as if your
headers had contained the defaulted ADDRESS instead. To cancel the
command, and cause the command parser to look at your headers again,
issue the command with no ADDRESS.

You can put several different "default user" commands in a single
email, each applying to other commands which follow.

Since confirm tokens always go to the address being altered, 'default'
will not allow someone to alter another person's subscription. Some
commands, such as changeaddr, require confirmation tokens from two
addresses (the address being changed and the address making the
request) so 'default user' can cause a token to be sent to an address
other than the one which sent the request.

Setting a default user is primarily useful when resubscribing
(see "help changeaddr"), and then only if the "From:" field of
the request message is incorrect. It can also be used by a list
owner to send info files, show output, etc. to someone who
simply can't figure out how to do it for themselves.

For example, a message sent from the server to the user's address
will have the "From" field address showing who sent the request
(rather than the server's address or the defaulted user's address).
The person sending the message to the server will still see the
result of the command (succeed, stall, fail) but none of the output.

Defaulting a user can make it much simpler to submit multiple
commands to the parser in one fell swoop.  For example, it makes
the following sets of commands equivalent:
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com
or:
    default password MYPASSWORD
    default password Real Name <someone@example.com>
    subscribe ONE-LIST
    subscribe TWO-LIST

See Also:
   help accept     (which may be required if default is not used)
   help approve    (like "default", but for only one command)
   help changeaddr (for how to replace one address with another)
   help password   (which changes an individual's password)
   help set        (for how to change some or all subscriptions)
