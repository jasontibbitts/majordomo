This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
management system at $SITE.

This is version $VERSION of Majordomo2.

If you're familiar with mail servers, information in receiving advanced
documentation on all available commands appears near the end of this
message.

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe and
unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list archives.

You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands in the
body of mail messages addressed to "$WHOAMI".
Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does not
process commands there.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself.

If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail or if your mail
program appends additional text to your mail, Majordomo may mistakenly
believe each line of your message is a command; you will then receive
spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening, either put a line
starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature, or put a line with just
the word

        end

on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
processing your signature as bad commands.

Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:

I.      FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM

To get a list of lists on this system that are available to you, put the
following line in the body of your mail message to $WHOAMI:

        lists

Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
of the list.

To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
about which you wish information is "example", you would put the line

        info example

in the body of the mail message.

II.     SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST

Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
list, so you can begin receiving mailings.

To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:

        subscribe example

Consult the help topic "subscribing" for more information and additional
options.  See the section "HELP TOPICS" below for instructions on doing
this.

Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added
to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification that
an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message will be
sent to the address to be subscribed containing the key, and directing the
user to send a command found in that message back to $WHOAMI.
(This can be a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being
swamped in extra email by someone who forged requests from your address.)
You may also get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the
list owner for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about
who may subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list
owner should contact you soon after your request.

Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
list policies and features.  Please SAVE THIS MESSAGE for future reference;
it will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
to $WHOAMI:

        intro example

(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "example").

III.    UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS

Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:

        unsubscribe example

(This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
address is shown in your mail.)

To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
the request, give that address in the command:

        unsubscribe example $USER

(The following is currently UNIMPLEMENTED!)
In either of these cases, you can tell $WHOAMI to remove
the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
in place of the list name:

        unsubscribe *
        unsubscribe * $USER

IV.    HELP TOPICS

Additional information is available from this server in the form of help
topics.  You are reading the default topic now.  To read another topic,
send the command

        help topic

Available topics include (not all of these are written yet):

  admin             Additional information for list administrators
  commands          A complete end-user command reference
  unsubscribing     More info on removing yourself from a list
  subscribing       More info on adding yourself to a list

There is also a separate help topic for each command containing an in-depth
description of all possible options.

IV.    GETTING MORE HELP

To contact a human site manager, send mail to $OWNER.  To contact the owner
of a specific list, send mail to that list's owner address, which is
formed by adding "-owner" to the user-name portion of the list's
address.  For instance, to contact the list owner for example@$WHEREAMI,
you would send mail to example-owner@$WHEREAMI.

To get another copy of this help message, send mail to $WHOAMI
with a line saying

        help

in the message body.
