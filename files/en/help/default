NOTE: This help file is for the command called "default". To get
      basic help, just send "help" to the server (not "help default").

The 'default' command sets certain defaults used by the command parser
for processing one or more commands. It is most often used by list
owners and administrators, but can also be used by subscribers.
This is not a general variable mechanism, it is ONLY for providing
the listed values. If the value is omitted, the default setting is
removed. This allows you to have a default for some commands but
not for others.

 The following defaults can be set:

    language:  (Not implemented.) Sets the default language preference
               list to the comma-separated list of two-letter language
               abbreviations.

    list:      Sets the default list for commands to the provided list.
               To clear the default list, don't supply one.

    password:  Approves all following commands with the given password.
               To clear the password, don't supply one.

    prefix:    (Not implemented.) Sets a prefix that (if present) will be
               deleted from the beginning of all following lines.

    user:      Replaces the address found in the "From:" field of your
               email headers.

The 'language' command (not implemented) is equivalent to the 'default
language' command, and is supplied for the benefit of those who do not
wish to see server messages in English.

Setting a default list makes the list an optional argument for all
commands which take one (excepting the createlist command).  Note that
this is not without ambiguity, as the parser cannot always tell when
the default list is implied.  When running at the -request address,
the parser generally starts with a default list in place.

Setting a default password will implicitly do the equivalent of
'approve password' at the beginning of all following command lines.
List subscribers will find little use for "default", except that
it can make command lines shorter. List administrators will find
it especially useful when returning the output of a 'configshow'
command to the parser to change some variables; simply add the
'default password' command to the beginning of the message or file,
and the parser will accept the 'configset' commands exactly as
dumped by the configshow command.

Setting a default user is primarily useful when resubscribing
(see "help changeaddr"), and then only if the "From:" field of
the request message is incorrect. It can also be used by an
expert to send info files, show output, etc. to someone who
simply can't figure out how to do it for themselves.

When a "default user" command is in effect, any command that looks
at your headers to see who sent the command will behave differently.
For example, a message sent from the server to the user's address
will have the "From" field address showing who sent the request
(rather than the server's address or the defaulted user's address).
The person sending the message to the server will still see the
result of the command (succeed, stall, fail) but none of the output.

You can put different "default user" commands in a single email,
each applying to other commands which follow. Since confirm
messages go to the address being altered, defaulting has no
impact on their destination unless the requester (which is set
by the default user command) is identical to the 'victim'.

These default commands make it much simpler to submit multiple
commands to the parser in one fell swoop.  For example, it makes
the following sets of commands equivalent:
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com
or:
    default password MYPASSWORD
    subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com

The more commands you have, the more "default" helps you.

See Also:
   help accept   (which may be required if default is not used)
   help approve  (like "default", but for only one command)
   help password (which changes an individual's password)
