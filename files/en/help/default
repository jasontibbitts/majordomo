setting, required, is one of debug, delay, display, list, password, user
value, if specified, is the value assigned to the setting
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The default command can be used to change the value of one of
the following six settings.

debug    - The amount of diagnostic information recorded about
           a command.

delay    - The length of time a command is delayed.

display  - How the results of a command are presented.

list     - The name of a mailing list.

password - An administrative or personal Majordomo password.

user     - The e-mail address of the person on whose behalf a command
           is made.

Each setting is described in more detail later in this document.

The biggest benefit of the default command is that it can save you a lot
of typing.  For example, if you use the "default list" command at
the beginning of an e-mail message to identify your mailing list, you
will not need to type your list's name repeatedly if you issue several
commands for the list.

The default command is only used by the e-mail and mj_shell interfaces.
It has no effect upon the web interfaces.

The "default debug" and "default display" commands are only relevant to
the mj_shell interface.  They are not recognized by the e-mail command
parser.  See "help mj_shell" for more information about the mj_shell
program.


default debug LEVEL
-------------------
The "default debug" command can be used to change the amount of
diagnostic information that is displayed during an mj_shell session.
The information is sent to STDERR, so by default it will appear on your
screen if you are using the mj_shell program interactively.  By default,
the debug level is zero.  If you set it to 1000 or higher, all of the
information that is available will be displayed.  

See "help configset_debug" for more information on debug levels.


default delay TIMESPAN
----------------------
This command causes each succeeding command to be delayed, then
run automatically at some later time by the mj_trigger program. 
See the "Time spans" section of "help times" for a description of
how to specify time spans.  See "help mj_trigger" and 
"help configset_triggers" for more information about triggers.

For example, the following command:

  default delay 3h

would cause all subsequent commands to be delayed by three hours.
If the timespan is simply a number, it is assumed to be a number of
seconds.  For example, the following command:

  default delay 30

would delay all subsequent commands by 30 seconds.

Delays may only be used by list administrators.  See "help delay" for
more information about delays.


default display PROGRAM
-----------------------
With the mj_shell program, when you type a command, sometimes the results
occupy more than one page on your screen.  The default display command
makes the results easier to read.  There are two programs supported,
pager and editor.

The pager program, usually "more" or "less," is taken from the PAGER 
environment variable.  After you finish reading the output and quit
the pager, you will return to the mj_shell command line and have
the opportunity to type more commands.

The editor program, such as "emacs," "vi," or "pico," is taken from
the EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable.  After you finish editing
the output of the commands, the mj_shell program will read the edited
output and attempt to issue any commands it contains.  For example,
if you would like to remove some addresses that have been experiencing
delivery failures, you could use these two commands:

  default display editor
  who-bounces LISTNAME

where LISTNAME is the name of your mailing list.  With the editor, 
you could then add unsubscribe commands to the output and remove
several addresses at once.

To turn off the editor or pager feature, use this command:

  default display

If the mj_shell program is run with the "-P" option, the pager will
be turned on immediately.


default list LISTNAME
---------------------
Setting a default list makes it unnecessary to type the list name in any
succeeding commands which require a list name (except the createlist
command).  For example, if you manage a list called "clarinet," the
following commands could be used to remove jane@example.com from, and
add joe@example.com to, your list:

  default list clarinet
  unsubscribe jane@example.com
  subscribe joe@example.com

If you not want a default list, use the following command:

  default list


default password PASSWORD
-------------------------
When you use the "default password" command in an  e-mail message or
mj_shell session, that password will automatically be applied to each
succeeding command.  This is much easier than using the "approve"
command to indicate the password for each command.

For example, the following two sets of commands are equivalent:

    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe clarinet
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe hautbois

    default password MYPASSWORD
    subscribe clarinet
    subscribe hautbois

The second approach can save some typing if you want to issue several
commands.


default user ADDRESS
--------------------
The "default user" command can be used to change the e-mail address on
whose behalf a command is issued.  The ADDRESS is a regular email
address, optionally containing comments, for example:
  default user joe@example.com
  default user Joe Blow <joe@example.com>
  default user joe@example.com (Joe Blow)

In an e-mail message, the user's address is taken from the "From:"
header of the message.  In an mj_shell session, the user's address is
usually determined by the system login name of the person who is running
the program.  When a "default user" command is in effect, the command
parser will act as if the user address in the command had issued any
subsequent commands.  To return the user address to its original value,
use the following command:

  default user

In the e-mail interface, the "default user" command can be used to send
the results of a command to another person.  For example, if you use
the following two commands:

  default user jane@example.com
  faq trumpet

the FAQ for the trumpet list will be mailed to jane@example.com.  The
message that is sent to Jane will have your e-mail address in the
"From:" header.  This feature does not apply to the mj_shell interface
in interactive mode, but it does apply if mj_shell is run with the 
"-F" switch, and reads commands from a file.

The following two sets of commands are equivalent:
    
  subscribe clarinet Joe Blow <joe@example.com>
  subscribe hautbois Joe Blow <joe@example.com>

  default user Joe Blow <joe@example.com>
  subscribe clarinet
  subscribe hautbois

The second approach can save some typing if you plan to issue several
commands for a single address.

Some Majordomo commands require more than one e-mail address, in which
case the "default user" command must be used to specify the second
address.  For example, the following two commands:

  default user new@example.com
  changeaddr old@example.com

will move all of the subscriptions of old@example.com to
new@example.com.

In another example, the following two commands:

  default user old@example.com
  alias new@example.com

will cause the address new@example.com to become an alias for the
address old@example.com.


Using list admin credentials for GLOBAL commands (advanced topic)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Majordomo supports several commands which are GLOBAL in scope, and
usually require the authority of a domain or site manager to execute
without confirmation.  These commands include the alias, changeaddr,
createlist, password, register, rekey, unalias, and unregister commands.

If you are a list administrator, you can indicate your credentials
using the "default list" and "default password" commands:

  default list YOURLIST
  default password YOURPASSWORD

Usually, these credentials have no impact upon GLOBAL commands.
However, a domain or site administrator could change the GLOBAL access
rules to allow list administrators to run GLOBAL commands, using
the list_password access variable.  For example, the following GLOBAL
access rule:

  alias
  allow
  $list_password

would allow all list administrators to use the alias command to create
aliases for their subscribers.  In that case, the following commands
would be needed for list administrators to create an alias:

  default list LISTNAME
  default password ADMIN_PASSWORD
  default user OLD_ADDRESS
  alias NEW_ADDRESS

(Another, more secure, option is to define a GLOBAL password for the
alias command and to distribute it to list administrators who need it.
See "help configset_passwords" for more details.)
