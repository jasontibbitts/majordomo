Sets a default value for a variable used by the command parser when
processing a batch of commands.  Currently, you may set a default
approval password or a default list name. This is not a general
variable mechanism, it is ONLY for defaulting lists and passwords.

The 'default' command sets certain defaults for the duration of the
parsing.  The following defaults can be set:

    password:  approves all following commands with the given password.
               To clear the password, don't supply one.

    list:      sets the default list for commands to the provided list.
               To clear the default list, don't supply one.

    language:  (Not implemented) sets the default language preference list
               to the comma-separated list of two-letter language
               abbreviations.

    prefix:    (Not implemented) sets a prefix that (if present) will be
               deleted from the beginning of all following lines.

The 'language' command (not implemented) is equivalent to the 'default
language' command above, and is supplied for the benefit of users.

If the value is omitted, the default setting is removed. This allows
you to have a default for some commands but not for others.

Setting a default password will implicitly do the equivalent of
'approve password' at the beginning of all following command lines.
List subscribers will find little use for "default", except that
it can make command lines shorter. List administrators will find
it especially useful when returning the output of a 'configshow'
command to the parser to change some variables; simply add the
'default password' command to the beginning of the message or file,
and the parser will accept the 'configset' commands exactly as
dumped by the configshow command.

Setting a default list makes the list an optional argument for all
commands which take one (excepting the createlist command).  Note that
this is not without ambiguity, as the parser cannot always tell when
the default list is implied.  When running at the -request address,
the parser generally starts with a default list in place.

Both of these commands make it much simpler to submit multiple
commands to the parser in one fell swoop.  For example, it makes
the following sets of commands equivalent:
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    approve MYPASSWORD subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com
or:
    default password MYPASSWORD
    subscribe ONE-LIST someone@example.com
    subscribe TWO-LIST someone@example.com

The more commands you have, the more "default" helps you.

==> see also: accept   (which may be required if default is not used)
==> see also: approve  (like "default", but for only one command)
==> see also: password (which changes an individual's password)
