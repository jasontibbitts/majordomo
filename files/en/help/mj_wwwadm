The WWW interface for list administrators is located at:
  $WWWADM_URL?domain=$DOMAIN

Instructions are available there.

The wwwadm script uses several approaches to determine which of
a site's virtual domains is being accessed.

  * The domain could appear in the URL path, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm/domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could be provided in the data, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm?domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could appear in the host name, for example:

    http://virtual.example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm


Actions performed with this CGI script will be logged with the IP
address of the remote host, e.g.,

  y127.0.0.1@example.com
