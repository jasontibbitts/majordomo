The WWW interface for list administrators is located at:
  $WWWADM_URL

Instructions are available there.

The wwwadm script uses several approaches to determine which of
a site's virtual domains is being accessed.

  * The domain could appear in the URL path, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm/domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could be provided in the data, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm?domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could appear in the host name, for example:

    http://virtual.example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm


Actions performed with this CGI script will be logged with the IP
address of the remote host, for example,

  y192.168.0.17@example.com

After a list administrator has signed in, a temporary password ("latchkey")
is substituted for the permanent password, to prevent the real password
being recorded.  This password looks like a token identifier, for example,

  34FE-910B-D055
    
and is valid for an hour by default.  For more information on latchkeys,
see "help configset_latchkey_lifetime".

If the GLOBAL www_help_window setting is turned on, all of the links for
help files will cause the help documents to be displayed in a separate
window.
