The WWW interface for list administrators is located at:
  $WWWADM_URL

Basic instructions are available at that location.

The mj_wwwadm script uses several approaches to determine which of
a site's virtual Majordomo domains is being accessed.  If the name of
your virtual domain is "virtual.example.com",

  * The domain could appear in the URL path, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm/domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could be provided in the URL query string or as
    a field in an HTML form, for example:

    http://example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm?domain=virtual.example.com

  * The domain could appear in the host name, for example:

    http://virtual.example.com/cgi-bin/mj_wwwadm

If the domain cannot be determined from any of these three ways, 
the default domain (the first domain listed in the "mj-domains" file
in the "ALIASES" directory) will be used.

Actions performed with this CGI script will be logged with the IP
address of the remote host, for example,

  y192.168.0.17@example.com

After a list administrator has signed in, a temporary password ("latchkey")
is substituted for the permanent password, to prevent the real password
being recorded.  This password looks like a token identifier, for example,

  34FE-910B-D055
    
and is valid for an hour by default.  For more information on latchkeys,
see "help configset_latchkey_lifetime".

If the GLOBAL www_help_window setting is turned on, all of the links for
help files will cause the help documents to be displayed in a separate
window.

More than one mailing list can be moderated at the same time with the
wwwadm interface, if you use a password that applies to all of the
lists.  To moderate more than one list, add each list name in the name
by which this script is called, and place forward slashes between the
list names.  For example, if you manage mailing lists named "broccoli" and
"rhubarb," instead of:

  $WWWADM_URL

visit the following location:

  $WWWADM_URL/broccoli/rhubarb
