$INCLUDE-config/file_search

Majordomo comes with a library of files in various languages and these
can be explicitly searched.  When it appears in the list slot, the
special string 'STOCK' indicates that the stock library of files is
searched.

Note that the 'DEFAULT' pseudo-list may be used to provide defaults for
all lists in a domain.  DEFAULT and STOCK share all their files with all
lists.

If '\$LANG' appears in the path portion, it is expanded to the user's
current language choice if one is available.  If one is not available,
it will expand to the value of the 'default_language' configuration
setting.

Certain directories of the DEFAULT and STOCK lists are always searched
after everything else to provide defaults; these directories correspond
to the following entries:

  DEFAULT:\$LANG
  DEFAULT:
  STOCK:\$LANG
  STOCK:en

Thus, any default files are searched, followed by domain-local files in
the preferred language, followed by any domain-local files not in any
specific language directory, followed by stock files in the preferred
language, finally followed by English files.  An English version of any
file which Majordomo uses internally will always be present.
