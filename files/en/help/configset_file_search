This provides a search-path mechanism for filename lookup.  Entries are of
the form

  list:path

where 'list' is the name of a list and path is the path within the
list's filespace.  'list' can be empty, in which case this list is used.
'path' can be empty, in which case the root of the filespace is used.
Thus ':' refers to the top of the filespace of this list.

To access files of another list, that list must must contain this
list's name in its file_share setting.  If the referenced list does
not share with this list, the relevant entries will be ignored.

Majordomo comes with a library of files in various languages and these
can be explicitly searched.  When it appears in the list slot, the 
special string 'STOCK' indicates that the stock library of default 
files is searched.

Note that the 'GLOBAL' and 'DEFAULT' pseudo-lists may be used to provide 
defaults for all lists in a domain.  GLOBAL, DEFAULT, and STOCK share all 
their files with all lists.

If '\$LANG' appears in the path portion, it is expanded to the user's
current language choice if one is available.  If one is not available,
it will expand to the value of the 'default_language' configuration
setting.

Certain directories of the GLOBAL and STOCK lists are always searched
after everything else to provide defaults; these directories
correspond to the following entries:

  DEFAULT:
  GLOBAL:\$LANG
  GLOBAL:
  STOCK:\$LANG
  STOCK:en

Thus, any default files are searched, followed by domain-local files 
in the preferred language, followed by any domain-local files 
not in any specific language directory, followed by stock files 
in the preferred language, finally followed by English files.  
An English version of any file which Majordomo uses internally 
will always be present.
