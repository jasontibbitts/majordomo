This provides a search-path mechanism for filename lookup.  Entries are of
the form

  list:path

where 'list' is the name of a list and path is the path within the
list's filespace.  'list' can be empty, in which case this list is used.
'path' can be empty, in which case the root of the filespace is used.
Thus ':' refers to the top of the filespace of this list.

To access files of another list, that list must must contain this
list's name in its file_share variable.  If the referenced list does
not share with this list, the relevant entries will be ignored.
When it appears in the list slot, the special string 'STOCK'
indicates that the stock library of default files is searched.
Majordomo comes with a library of files in various languages and these
can be explicitly searched.

Note that the special list 'GLOBAL' exists to provide defaults for
all lists in the domain.  GLOBAL and STOCK share all their files with
all lists.

If '\$LANG' appears in the path portion, it is expanded to the user's
current language choice if one is available.  If one is not available,
it will expand to the value of the 'default_language' variable.

Certain directories of the GLOBAL and STOCK lists are always searched
after everything else to provide defaults; these directories
correspond to the following entries:

  GLOBAL:\$LANG
  GLOBAL:
  STOCK:\$LANG
  STOCK:en

Thus any domain-local files in the preferred language are searched,
followed by any domain-local files not in any specific language
directory, followed by stock files in the preferred language, finally
followed by English files.  An English version of any file which
Majordomo makes use of internally will always be present.
