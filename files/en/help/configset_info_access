EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/info_access

This setting determines who can use the info command to retrieve
the info document for a list.  The info document normally
resides in a list's private file space, and therefore can also be
accessed by the get and index commands, but only by list administrators.

If an info document does not exist for the list, the info command
will cause a default document to be retrieved from the DEFAULT or
GLOBAL pseudo-list, or from the stock files supplied by Majordomo.

An administrative password can be used to issue the info command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the info command  
will take precedence over the value of this setting.

The info document is normally attached to the welcome message which is
sent to new subscribers when they join a mailing list.
