Chunks are used by "iterated" commands.  The information that is
processed in chunks varies according to the command that is being run,
as shown in the following table: 

Command     Chunks of...
-------     ------------
announce    addresses from a subscriber database.
archive     lines from messages in the archive.
faq         lines from a file.
get         lines from a file.
help        lines from a file.
info        lines from a file.
intro       lines from a file.
post        addresses from a subscriber database.
put         lines in a file.
rekey       addresses from a subscriber database.
report      lines from the log.
sessioninfo lines from a file.
tokeninfo   lines from a session file or posted message.
who         addresses from a subscriber database.

The chunksize has no impact on the output that is displayed for a
command. It only affects the computer resources required to execute a
command.
