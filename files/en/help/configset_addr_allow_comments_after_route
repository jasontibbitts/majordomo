EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL addr_allow_comments_after_route = 1


If this is true, Majordomo will allow addresses with comments after the <>
bracked route portion of an address.
This command, if set to a value of "1", allows "subscribe" commands
to be processed with technically illegal email addresses.

This is always legal:
   Joe Blow <joe@blow.com>

This is only accepted if "addr_allow_comments_after_route" is true:
   <joe@blow.com> Joe Blow
