EXAMPLE:
configset listname max_mime_header_length = 128


Sets the maximum length of any single header in a MIME part in number
of characters. Set to zero to disable the MIME header length check. 
Actual MIME header size and a boolean for exceeding this limit can be
tested in access_rules.

Some mail reading programs are subject to crashing or security exploits
when passed messages with MIME headers that exceed a certain length.
While these mailers are definitely flawed and their users should contact
the manufacturers for upgrades, this variable is provided to filter out
such messages.

Note that this setting does not implement any filtering for the security
exploits that can occur in the contents of the various parts of the body
of a message; this must be done with appropriate settings of taboo_body
and attachment_rules.  (Filtering of HTML mail is recommended to help
eliminate exploits which lie in HTML tags.)
