# max_mime_header_length
# (128)                [integer] <resend>
# Sets the maximum length of any single header in a MIME part.  Some mail
# reading programs are subject to crashing or security exploits when passed
# messages with MIME headers that exceed a certain length.  While these
# mailers are definitely flawed and their users should contact the
# manufacturers for upgrades, this variable is provided to filter out such
# messages.
#
# Note that this setting does not implement any filtering for the security
# exploits that can occur in the contents of the various parts of the body of
# a message; this must be done with appropriate settings of taboo_body and
# attachment_rules.  (Filtering of HTML mail is recommended to help eliminate
# exploits which lie in HTML tags.)
