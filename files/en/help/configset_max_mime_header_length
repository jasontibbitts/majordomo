EXAMPLE:
configset listname max_mime_header_length = 128


Sets the maximum length of any single header in a MIME part.  Some mail
reading programs are subject to crashing or security exploits when passed
messages with MIME headers that exceed a certain length.  While these
mailers are definitely flawed and their users should contact the
manufacturers for upgrades, this variable is provided to filter out such
messages.

Note that this setting does not implement any filtering for the security
exploits that can occur in the contents of the various parts of the body of
a message; this must be done with appropriate settings of taboo_body and
attachment_rules.  (Filtering of HTML mail is recommended to help eliminate
exploits which lie in HTML tags.)
