The configdef command resets one or more configuration settings to
their default values.  Multiple settings can be reset by separating them
with commas or spaces.  In addition, a here document can be used to
list the settings.  In the following two examples, the access_rules
and moderate settings will be reset. 

  Example:
configdef LISTNAME access_rules,moderate

  Example:
configdef LISTNAME <<ABCD
access_rules
moderate
ABCD

A valid mailing list name should be substituted for LISTNAME in each
example.  Please see "help here_document" for an introduction to writing
multi-line command using here documents.

For each mailing list, Majordomo keeps a table which lists all of the
values that have been changed explicitly using the configset command.
The configdef command removes one or more entries from that table, which
causes the setting to be assigned a default value.  Consequently, using
the configdef command is not the same as using the configset command to
change a setting to the current default value.  

If a setting is reset with the configdef command, its value will change
if the default value of the setting changes.  To learn how the default
values are determined, see the "Configuration templates and default
values" section of the "help admin_config" document.

The configdef command requires the use of an administrative password.
Please see "help admin_passwords" for more details.

To see a complete list of configuration settings, use the "help topics"
command.
