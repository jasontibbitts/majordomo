The first line of each file description will be displayed in the Subject
header of a message if the file is the first file to appear in a farewell
message.  Otherwise, the first line will appear in a Content-Description
header of an attachment to the farewell message.

The first field of the second line of a file description is a file name.
The file must already be present in the file space of your mailing list.
The "get" command can be used to verify that the file exists:

  get-immediate LISTNAME FILENAME

Files can be created in the file space using the "put" command.

The second field of the second line of a file description is an optional
flag field.  Three flags are supported:  

  * 'E' causes the file to be included only if it exists in the list's
     explicit search path (as specified by the file_search setting).  The
     default locations will not be searched.  If the file does not exist,
     it will be completely ignored.

  * 'N' indicates that the file should be the first part of a new farewell 
     message; 

  * 'S' causes the file to undergo variable substitution (and possibly 
     auto-inclusion of additional files).  The variables supported include
     the standard substitutions, plus USER, PASSWORD, FRONTER, FOOTER,
     RANDOM_FRONTER, RANDOM_FOOTER, ALL_FRONTERS, and ALL_FOOTERS.  See
     "help variables" for a description of each substitution variable.

Regardless of whether the 'S' flag is present, the substitutions will be
applied to the subject from the first line of the description.


It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
You can use comments as a reminder of what a file does or why
it was chosen, but comments have no impact on how the setting works.
