listname, required, is an email list at this site (or GLOBAL)
filename, required, is the pathname of the file to be sent
-edit,      if specified, allows a document to be edited and replaced easily
-immediate, if specified, returns text inline instead of separate email

Each mailing list has a "file space," a collection of directories
in which important documents are stored.  It is possible to view
the contents of the file space with the index command, and to
retrieve individual files in the file space with the get command.
Documents in the file space typically include archives of posted
messages, and the "faq," "info," and "intro" documents which are
displayed using the corresponding commands with the same names.

Files retrieved with the get command are normally mailed to you
in a separate message, one file per message. The get-immediate command 
will cause each document to be returned inline, instead of being mailed
in a separate message.  

File names are case sensitive! Be sure to type upper and
lower case letters exactly as they are shown by the index command.
List names are NOT case sensitive.

The faq, info, and intro commands are nearly shortcuts for the get
command. For example, "get LISTNAME /faq" and "faq LISTNAME" will
return the same document, but the faq command will perform keyword
substitutions that enhance the content; see "help variables" for 
more details.

Each mailing list has a configuration setting, get_access, which
controls who can retrieve files from the file space.  If you 
attempt to retrieve a file with a restrictive get_access setting,
you may receive a "permission denied" error.

Note that "filename" is actually a file pathname, and may include
one or more levels of directories (also called folders). The index
command will show which entries are files and which are directories.
For example, if list "MYLIST" contains a file called "TOPFILE" in
addition to a directory "SUBDIR" and a file in that directory which
is called "ANOTHERFILE", then these commands would be valid:
  get MYLIST TOPFILE
  get MYLIST SUBDIR/ANOTHERFILE
where a slash "/" separates the directory name from the file name.

The get-edit command causes the entire file to be wrapped in a "put"
command.  This makes it easy for you to edit and replace an existing 
file.

Normally, archived posts are retrieved with the archive-get command, 
and the index and get commands will not allow archive retrieval if 
the archive_dir configuration setting is set to somewhere outside 
the list's file space.

                           Notes for list owners:

Each list's file space consists of a private top-level directory, which
in turn contains a "public" directory.  The files outside
the public directory cannot be accessed with the get command
unless an administrative password is used.

When the file name specified with the get command begins with
a solidus, '/',  Majordomo looks for the file relative to the top-level 
directory.  If the file name does not begin with a solidus, Majordomo 
looks for the file underneath the public directory.

To see the difference between the top-level and public directories,
use the following two commands:

  index-recursive LISTNAME /
  index-recursive LISTNAME
