This command returns a file from the list, which the list owner must
have previously stored there. If no such file exists, or if you are
not authorized to get it, the "get" command returns an error message.

Each list may be set up so that different sets of people can "get"
files from it. If get fails, contact the list owner to make sure you
asked for the right file name or try "index-recursive listname" to
get a list of all files you can access.

List and file names are case sensitive! Be sure to type upper and
lower case letters exactly as they are shown by "index".

Note that "filename" is actually a file pathname, and may include
one or more levels of directories (also called folders). The "index"
command will show which entries are files and which are directories.
For example, if list "MYLIST" contains a file called "TOPFILE" in
addition to a directory "SUBDIR" and a file in that directory which
is called "ANOTHERFILE", then these commands would be valid:
  get MYLIST TOPFILE
  get MYLIST SUBDIR/ANOTHERFILE
where a slash "/" separates the directory name from the file name.

==> see also: index      (find out which files are available for "get")
==> see also: put        (to create files or directories under a list)
