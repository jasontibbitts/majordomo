The "subscribe" command adds an "address" to the named list. Unless
the command is "approve"d in advance, a confirmation token may be
sent to the given "address" (based on the subscribe_policy or the
access_rules settings for "listname") to verify this action, and must
be replied to with an "accept" command before the subscription is done.

To subscribe to the LISTNAME email broadcast list at this site,
as simply as possible, send this one-line message to $MJ:
    subscribe LISTNAME YourEmailAddress
replacing "LISTNAME" with the name of the list and replacing
"YourEmailAddress" with the address you want to subscribe to the
list. Additional commands may be required, but you will receive
messages telling you what to do if necessary.

Sometimes the list name plus your email address is too long, and
your mail tool will 'wrap' the line by inserting a hard return or
line break. See the syntax section of "help commands" for how to
diagnose and fix this problem.

When an address is first subscribed to any list at this site, it is
automatically put in the registration database and the register command
can not be used until that address is unregistered. Unregistering will
automatically remove that address from all lists at this site, or the
unsubscribe command can be used to selectively remove an address from
one list at a time.

It is possible to register, get a password, and then use "approve"
to subscribe to several lists instead of using "accept" to confirm
each subscription. List owners and site administrators with list
passwords can also pre-approve subscriptions to bypass "accept".

Unless the "-nowelcome" option is used, Majordomo will send a message
to "address" with an explanation of how to use the list. Each list
owner can decide how many files, if any, new subscribers will receive.

If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
(a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
the command. The "accept" confirmation would then be sent to that address.

The reason that many lists require additional confirmation is that it is in
general impossible to verify that the address being subscribed to the list
is indeed the person who sent the request.  This fact is frequently
exploited to forge subscription requests which result in hassles for the
victim and all of the list owners.  By sending a message to the subscriber
address and requiring a valid reply the abuse is limited to the single
confirmation message; the victim does not have to go through the hassle of
being removed from the list.  In addition, Majordomo2 stores information
about the source of the forged requests and if a rejection is sent in
response to the confirmation message, this stored information is
automatically forwarded to various responsible parties.

The address need not be a simple email address. Comment fields are
preserved in the registration database. These are all valid addresses:
   joe@blow.com
   Joe Blow <joe@blow.com>
   "Joe Blow 555-1212" joe@blow.com
   joe@blow.com (Joe Blow)
Note that registering with a name or other comment field is not
required, but it may help a site administrator find your address
in the event you need help later. The name or comment portion must
be enclosed in quotes if it contains certain characters like periods
or other puncutation.

In addition, other technically illegal addresses can be used
but only if the site administrator has enabled them. See these
help files for details:
   help configset addr_allow_at_in_phrase
   help configset addr_allow_bang_paths
   help configset addr_allow_comments_after_route
   help configset addr_allow_ending_dot

Upon subscribing, you should (unless you specified otherwise) receive an
introductory message containing list policies and features.  Save this
message for future reference; it will also contain exact directions for
unsubscribing.  If you lose the intro mail and would like another copy of
the policies, send this message to $MJ
        intro LISTNAME
(substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "LISTNAME").
