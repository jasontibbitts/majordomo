$INCLUDE-config/token_remind

Setting this value to 0 will prevent reminder messages from being sent.
Regardless of the value of this setting, no more than one reminder
message will be sent automatically for a particular token.

Reminder messages are sent periodically, as indicated by the "token"
trigger in the GLOBAL triggers configuration setting.  By default, this
happens daily.

It is possible to override the token_remind value in certain cases by
using the "remind" notify variable in a notify directive in the
access_rules configuration setting.  See "help access_variables" and
"help configset_access_rules" for more information.

It is possible to send a reminder message to someone by using the
tokeninfo-remind command.  See "help tokeninfo" for more details.
