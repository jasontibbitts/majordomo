A table containing attachment rules, which describe how various MIME
types are to be treated when they appear in messages sent to the list.

A rule consists of a MIME type (or regular expression matching a MIME
type) and a list of actions to perform when a message with this type
or containing a part of this type passes through the list.  It looks
something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some MIME types are:

text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, video/mpeg

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the part pass
  deny      - reject the entire message
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest
  consult   - send the entire message to the list owner for approval
  (more are planned)

allow and consult take an argument; if present, it should be a
content-transfer-encoding.
Majordomo will change the encoding of the
part to match before it is sent.  Some valid encodings are "8bit",
"base64", "quoted-printable", "x-uuencode" and "x-gzip64".  If an
argument is not provided, the encoding will be left as is.  Due to the
nature of MIME, be aware that the encoding can be changed at any
machine that the message passes through, so the encoding you choose
will not necessarily be the encoding that list members will see (and
some may see different encodings than the others).

Note that the first matching rule is the one that is used and types
are by default allowed if no rule matches.  Deny and consult rules are
applied first, and discard rules always apply, even for approved
messages.

Note also that deny and consult just set variables that can be checked
in access_rules.  The default rule for posting normally takes care of
these, but if you add any additional rules is is possible to override
the checks made here.

A typical rule for this command looks like this:
   mime/type | action=argument

The first field can be either an exact string (that is checked without regard
to upper/lower case) or it can be a pattern (as defined by "help patterns").

Do not confuse this syntax with that of "access_rules"! The "action" may be
set to "consult", but you can not specify a replyfile with "attachment_rules".
You can, however, use these variables in "access_rules" to send a very precise
message to the list owner or back to the poster whenever a match occurs:
   \$mime_consult - true if any "consult" attachment_rules matched
   \$mime_deny    - true if any "deny"    attachment_rules matched
   \$mime         - true if either of \$mime_consult or \$mime_deny are true

NOTE: As of 2/99, \$mime was not implemented.

Pay close attention to the note above that says "discard" rules always apply.
This can be used to delete portions of a message while letting the rest go
out. Unlike "access_rules", all "attachment_rules" are processed each time...
and a message which is trapped for a "consult" action will be processed
again (for possible "discard") when it is delivered.

In the context of MIME, all messages have a tree structure, with each node
(including the root) having a type. Even if the message doesn't have any
MIME-like headers, it still has a MIME type. That type is 'text/plain'.

The "attachment_rules" command doesn't trap raw uuencode or any other form
of non-MIME attachment as of 2/99 - but it could, given patches. The original
proposal encompassed uuencoded and MS-TNEF and other stuff but nobody has
contributed the code. Feel free to do so! (By the way, using taboo_body or
admin_body to look for the "begin" tag of uuencoded data may fail if there
is a content-type header, because it is seen as part of MIME encoding, but
refer to "help configset admin_body" for more information.)

Simplistic mail clients cannot view anything other than plain text, and
while there ways to unpack attachments (like the "munpack" tool) it can
be enough of a hassle to discourage some readers. To disable ALL MIME
attachments, allowing only plain text, use this attachment_rule:
   text/plain | allow
   /.*/       | deny
but be sure to use "access_rules" to let the poster know what happened.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
