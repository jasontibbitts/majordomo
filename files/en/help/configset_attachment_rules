$INCLUDE-config/attachment_rules

Each message that is posted to a mailing list consists of one or more
body parts.  Each body part has a particular type, sometimes called a
"MIME type," which gives some indication about the contents of the part.
For example, a body part containing a WWW document might have a
"text/html" MIME type.  (MIME is an abbreviation for the name of the
Internet standard for giving names to types) 

Most plain text messages consist of one body part whose type is
"text/plain".  When a message has more than one body part, the second
and succeeding parts are usually called "attachments."  The
"attachment_rules" setting is somewhat misnamed, because the rules apply
to every body part, including the first part.

Each attachment rule occupies one line.  It is possible to place
comments before, between, and after the individual rules, to indicate to
other administrators what each rule is intended to accomplish.
Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.

The first rule that matches a particular body part takes precedence.
For example, in the following two rules:

  text/html | consult
  /^text/i  | deny

any message that contains a "text/html" body part will cause the list
moderators to be consulted; any message that contains another kind of
text body part, for instance "text/plain" or "text/enriched," will cause
the message to be denied.  Each part of a message body is examined
separately.  If no rule matches, the part is allowed and not altered.

The type on the left-hand side of an access rule can be an exact MIME
type, or it can be a pattern that potentially matches many different
MIME types (see "help patterns" for an explanation of how to write
patterns).  For example, to deny all messages containing GIF images, use
the following rule:

  image/gif | deny

and to discard all messages containing images of any type, use this rule:

  /^image/i | deny

Exact MIME type matches are case-insensitive; for instance, "image/jpeg"
and "Image/JPEG" are considered identical.


The allow action
----------------
The allow action causes a body part to be accepted.


The consult, deny, and require actions
--------------------------------------
If the contents of a message call for both consult and deny actions,
by default the deny action will take precedence.

By default, the consult action will cause a message to be sent to the
moderators of a mailing list for approval, and the deny action will
cause a message to be discarded entirely.  However, these default
actions can be overridden using the access_rules configuration setting.

The following access variables will be set by consult and deny actions,
and can be used in access rules for the "post" command:
   \$mime_consult - true if any "consult" rule matched a body part
   \$mime_deny    - true if any "deny"    rule matched a body part
   \$mime         - true if either of \$mime_consult or \$mime_deny is true
   \$mime_require - true if any "require" rule matched a body part

The require action is useful for determining if a certain kind of body
part is present in a message.  For example, the following rule:

  /^text/i | require

would cause the \$mime_require variable to be set if at least one text
body part (such as text/plain, text/html, or text/enriched) is present
in a message.  If you wish to prevent messages without a text body part
from being posted to a mailing list, you could then use the following rule
in the access_rules configuration setting:

  post
  deny, reason="Posted messages must have text in their bodies."
  !$mime_require

See "help configset_access_rules" for details on how to use these
variables in access rules.


Unimplemented features
----------------------
The allow and consult actions take an argument which is intended to be a
content-transfer-encoding.  Using a different encoding would cause the
encoding to be changed.   Some valid encodings are "8bit", "base64",
"quoted-printable", "x-uuencode" and "x-gzip64".  If an argument is not
provided, the encoding will be left as is.  Due to the nature of MIME,
be aware that the encoding can be changed at any machine that the
message passes through, so the encoding you choose will not necessarily
be the encoding that list members will see (and some may see different
encodings than the others).  At present, this feature is unimplemented.

The "attachment_rules" setting does not alter portions of text messages
that contain non-MIME attachments, such as uuencoded documents.
