This setting is only meaningful if message queueing is in use, and if
qmail is not the message transport agent.

Incoming mail is processed by the mj_enqueue program.  mj_enqueue has
two command options, '-P' and '-p', which are used to determine the
priority given to the domain and mailing list to which the message is
delivered.  If these options are not used, mj_enqueue uses a default
value of 10.  Higher numbers mean faster service, and higher-numbered
domains will always receive faster service than lower-numbered domains,
regardless of the priority of lists within each domain.

Changes to this setting will not take effect until the createlist-regen
command has been run to regenerate the mail aliases.
