NAME
    mj_queuerun - process outstanding queue entries.

DESCRIPTION
    The Majordomo queue runner program, mj_queuerun, examines a series of
    queue directories for messages. Each message that it finds will be
    processed unless another queue runner process is already processing that
    message. When a queue directory has more than one messages, the messages
    will be processed in a random order.

    A sequence counter is kept for each message in a queue directory. If a
    technical problem causes a queue runner to abort, a particular message
    may be examined more than once. If a message cannot be processed after
    three tries, a special emergency log will be kept for the fourth try. If
    the message cannot be processed on the fourth try, it will be discarded.

    After all of the messages have been processed, the queue runner will
    wait for a message from the queue server program, mj_queueserv. If a
    message is received, the queue runner will examine each of the queue
    directories again. Otherwise, the queue runner will exit.
