WARNING: If you set "noack", you may accidentally cause error
messages to vanish. (This is especially true when your list is
configured using using the "replyfile" option - if you are a
list owner, you should see "help configset access_rules".)

This command sets the values of various subscription parameters, some
of which can be pre-set by the list owner. The list owner can also
prevent subscribers from changing settings. The settings can be grouped
as follows (specify only one of each set, because each one will override
the others in the set):
  1. subscription class (each, digest, nomail)
  2. informative messages (ackall, ackimportant, noack)
  3. copies of your own posts (selfcopy, noselfcopy)
  4. being visible with "who" (hideall, hideaddress, nohide)
  5. list mail if you already got a CC (eliminatecc, noeliminatecc)
  6. subject prefix added by owner (prefix, noprefix)
  7. replyto header added by owner (replyto, noreplyto)

At the bottom of this file is a summary of all possible flags and a
cross reference to default settings that might be useful to list owners.

1. You can set your subscription class, which controls how (and if) you
   receive messages from the server.  There are three basic classes:
     each   - you get each message as it is posted.
     digest - you get periodic collections of messages.
     nomail - you get nothing.


  To receive each message from the list as it is posted, send this
  one-line command to $MJ
     set LISTNAME each YourEmailAddressHere
  where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list. This will turn
  off (or cancel) the digest and/or nomail options if they are in effect.


  To temporarily suspend all messages from the list, without unsubscribing,
  send this one-line command to $MJ
     set LISTNAME nomail YourEmailAddressHere
  where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list. You can also
  specify an amount of time that you would like to stop receiving mail,
  as a number of days/weeks/months. If you don't specify a time period,
  messages from the list will be suspended until you turn them back on
  with either 'digest' or 'each'. If you DO specify a time period, you
  will return to the 'digest' or 'each' setting you had before you set
  your subscription to 'nomail'. If you didn't specify a time period, or
  if you come back early, send this command to cancel "nomail":
     set LISTNAME nomail-return YourEmailAddressHere
  which will return you to 'each' or 'digest', however your subscription
  was set before you enabled 'nomail'.

  You can specify times in terms of "days", "weeks", and "months". You can
  leave off all but the first letter of the words  as in '2d', '2w', '2m'.
  For example, you can send commands like this to $MJ
     set LISTNAME nomail YourEmailAddressHere
  which suspends email from the list "LISTNAME" until you turn it back on,
     set LISTNAME nomail-4d YourEmailAddressHere
  which suspends email for four days, or
     set LISTNAME nomail-1months YourEmailAddressHere
  which suspends email for one month. Remember that "LISTNAME" is replaced
  with the name of the list where you are subscribed. If you come back

NOTE: You can use "nomail" or "vacation", they are identical commands.


  To receive groups of messages or just a list of messages from the list,
  instead of receiving each message one at a time, send this one-line
  command to $MJ
     set LISTNAME digest YourEmailAddressHere
  where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list.

WARNING: The "set digest" option is not fully implemented as of 2/99.

  Along with 'digest', you can specify which digest you want to receive and
  how you want it formatted. For example, you can send one of these commands
  in a message to $MJ
     set LISTNAME digest-daily-mime YourEmailAddressHere
     set LISTNAME digest-weekly-index YourEmailAddressHere
  where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list. The three supported
  types of digest you can receive are:
     mime  - a format supported by many of the newer mail clients.
     text  - the old, plain text digest format
     index - just an index of messages; you can retrieve the ones you want
             to see using the 'archive' command.
  The name of the digest, 'daily' and 'weekly' in the examples above, is
  optional. You can leave the digest name and format off the command to get
  the defaults provided by the list owner.

WARNING: The "archive" command is not implemented as of 2/99, "get" may work?

  You should refer to the introductory document for a list of which
  digests are available to you. You may choose a digest name based on
  what the list owner has already set up, which might NOT be the digest
  names shown here ('daily' or 'weekly'). To get that document, send
     intro LISTNAME
  using the actual list name, to the server at $MJ
  (If that doesn't discuss digests, you may have to contact the list
  owner at the special address LISTNAME-owner@$WHEREAMI)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2. To control what parts of the process Majordomo informs you of
   once your message is submitted, send one of these commands to
   the server $MJ

    set LISTNAME noack YourEmailAddressHere
       - You receive nothing about posts, whether they go to the list or
         bounce to the owner for review or are denied. You should monitor
         the list to see if your msg is posted.

    set LISTNAME ackimportant YourEmailAddressHere
       - You are notified if the message is held up for approval or
         denied due to rules the owner has set up for the list.

    set LISTNAME ackall YourEmailAddressHere
       - You receive everything you do when using "ackimportant", plus
         when your message is posted to the list you get a confirmation.

NOTE: As of 2/99, there is no posted message confirmation, so ackall
      and ackimportant are identical. This will change in the future.

NOTE: To override "noack" for denied posts, or to send additional information,
      the list owner can configure the list to override the user's settings.
      Refer to "help configset ack_denials_always" for how to bypass "noack",
      and "help configset ack_attach_original" for how to return the denied
      post along with the pre-defined error text. These are not user commands.

WARNING: Using "noack", the default, can make error messages vanish if
         your list has access_rules that use replyfile. If your list uses
         only mailfiles, using "noack" can suppress one of the two messages
         some errors produce. Use "set LISTNAME noack" with extreme caution.

   To make sure you get all messages from the server, send this one-line
   command to $MJ
      set LISTNAME ackall YourEmailAddressHere
   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3. These control whether or not you get a copy of your own message sent back
   to you.  (Assuming you are receiving 'each' message; 'digest' users will
   always see their own messages in the digest and 'nomail' users will
   obviously not receive their messages).

   To get copies of your own post from the list "LISTNAME", send this
   one-line command to $MJ
      set LISTNAME selfcopy YourEmailAddressHere

   To suppress copies of your own post from the list "LISTNAME", send this
   one-line command to $MJ
      set LISTNAME noselfcopy YourEmailAddressHere

   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4. These control whether or not users can see your address using 'who':
     hideall     - 'who' shows nothing about you.
     hideaddress - 'who' shows your name but not your email address
     nohide      - 'who' shows both your name and your address
     showall     - same as "nohide", shows all information

   For maximum privacy, send this one-line command to $MJ
      set LISTNAME hideall YourEmailAddressHere
   where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list.

   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

   The list owner can disable the "who" command several different ways,
   so even if you use "nohide" here others may be unable to get your
   name from the subscriber list. See "help who" for details.

   Your email address is stored separately from comment fields that were
   with it when you subscribed. The "hideaddress" setting will leave those
   comments visible, but only if you provided them when you registered or
   when you subscribed. For example, "Joe Blow <joe@blow.org>" has a
   comment (or name) of "Joe Blow"... but no one knows if that comment
   will be there for each subscriber or if it will represent a real name.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5. These control carbon copy elimination.  If this is on and your address
   appears in the To: or CC: headers of a message that Majordomo is
   processing, it will not send an additional copy to you.  This helps to
   cut down on many of those annoying duplicates that are often received,
   but it deprives you of the additional processin that Majordomo does on a
   message (subject prefixes, additional headers, etc.).
     eliminatecc   - turns CC elimination on
     noeliminatecc - turns it off

   To make sure you get all messages, even though they may be duplicates,
   send this one-line command to $MJ
      set LISTNAME noeliminatecc YourEmailAddressHere
   where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list.

   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6. These control subject prefix generation.  If the list owner has defined a
   prefix, you can specify whether or not you want to see it.
     prefix   - always add the prefix
     noprefix - never show the prefix

   To eliminate offensive subject prefixes, send this one-line command
   to $MJ
      set LISTNAME noprefix YourEmailAddressHere
   where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list.

   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

7. These control Reply-To: header generation.  If the list owner has defined
   a Reply-To: header, you can specify whether or not you want to see it.
     replyto   - always add the Reply-To: header
     noreplyto - never add the header (but if the poster has provided one,
                 you will see it)

   To eliminate list-specific Reply-To fields, send this one-line command
   to $MJ
      set LISTNAME noreplyto YourEmailAddressHere
   where "LISTNAME" is replaced with the name of the list.

   Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name.

WARNING: Different mail tools interpret the From, Sender, and Reply-To
         fields in different ways. Some don't even show you all the headers,
         so you should always check who a reply will go to before you send it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here is a summary of all possible flags, grouped into mutually
exclusive sets (specify only one of each set, because each one will
override the others in the set). Detailed descriptions are above.

Remember to put in your actual email address and the real list name!

1. Subscription class:                 (no such options in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME each EmailAddress                  (default subscription)
   set LISTNAME digest[-name][-index][-text][-mime] EmailAddress
   set LISTNAME nomail[-time] EmailAddress
   set LISTNAME vacation[-time] EmailAddress
NOTE: "nomail" and "vacation" are identical, use whichever you like.

2. Informative messages about your post:
   set LISTNAME ackall EmailAddress                 ('A' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME ackimportant EmailAddress           ('a' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME noack EmailAddress           (no a, no A in default_flags)

3. Whether you want a copy of your own posts:
   set LISTNAME selfcopy EmailAddress               ('S' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME noselfcopy EmailAddress            (no S in default_flags)

4. Whether you want to be visible with "who":
   set LISTNAME hideal EmailAddressl                ('H' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME hideaddress EmailAddress            ('h' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME nohide EmailAddress          (no h, no H in default_flags)

5. Suppress list mail if you already got a CC:
   set LISTNAME eliminatecc EmailAddress            ('C' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME noeliminatecc EmailAddress         (no C in default_flags)

6. Suppress subject prefix added by owner:
   set LISTNAME prefix EmailAddress                 ('P' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME noprefix EmailAddress              (no P in default_flags)

7. Suppress replyto header added by owner:
   set LISTNAME replyto EmailAddress                ('R' in default_flags)
   set LISTNAME noreplyto EmailAddress             (no R in default_flags)
