This file is specific to administrators! To get suggestions from a
user's perspective (as a list subscriber) send "help overview" or
"help commands" to the server at $MJ

Majordomo variables, for the purpose of message or file substitution,
are all upper case words with a leading dollar sign (common in Unix).

This file should contain ALL substitution variables, grouped by
which file or command they apply to. This file does NOT contain ANY
variables suitable for use in access_rules tests (for that kind of
variable, see "help configset access_rules_variables"), although it
does contain variables that can be evaluted in messages sent to the
user by access_rules.

As an example of a variable, using this string in a file
  \$MAJORDOMO
will cause the the address of the majordomo email interface to be
inserted before the user sees the file contents.

You must watch out for lines that get too long when the string
(or the contents of a file) replaces the variable name you type.

There are some cases where some variables are undefined... so the
user may see the actual variable name if you use a variable in the
wrong place. The most problematic variable in this respect is
"\$VICTIM", which is descriptive but may cause minor panic.

Note that \$INCLUDE is a special case, not mentioned in the per-file
list below, but available whenever any other variable substitution
is present! Most files may be modified 'on the fly' using \$INCLUDE
to auto-include other files as they are sent out. You can nest
includes 3 levels deep, so an included file can include another
file. More than 3 levels of nesting is taken to be an infinite loop,
and the inclusion is terminated with an error message.

If you use \$INCLUDE, the syntax is different than other variables.
This variable MUST be followed with a dash and then the path to the
file you want to include. Nothing else can be on the line before
the \$INCLUDE or after the file name. For example
  \$INCLUDE-help/topics
will pull the contents of "help topics" into your current file,
usually from the SITE/files/en/help directory. This variable should
be used only by skilled administrators, and only with full testing
before the files are released. It is especially critical to test
error messages, which may be hard to simulate. Proof is left to
the user that other pathnames will work.

If you mis-spell a variable, or use one that is not defined,
it will show up in the mail message exactly as you typed it (dollar
sign and all), so watch for these and be aware that unevaluated
variables do NOT cause errors to be logged.

You can keep variable evaluation from happening by escaping the
dollar sign with a backslash, as in
  \\$MAJORDOMO
which will appear as simply "\$MAJORDOMO" to the user.

See "help put" for information on how to change or create the various
files mentioned below, and for the meaning/use of each file.
