This file is specific to administrators! To get suggestions from a
user's perspective (as a list subscriber) send "help overview" or
"help commands" to the server at $MJ

Below is a list of all the variables a list or site administrator
may use. Variables generally follow Unix syntax, with a dollar sign
indicating evaluation and an upper-case string for the variable name.
For example using this string in a file:
  \$MAJORDOMO
will cause the the address of the majordomo email interface to be
inserted before the user sees the file contents.

Note that \$INCLUDE is a special case! Most files may be modified
'on the fly' by using \$INCLUDE to auto-include other files as they
are sent out. You can nest included files 3 levels deep, so an
included file can include another file. More than 3 levels of
nesting is taken to be an infinite loop, and the inclusion is
terminated with an error message.

There are some cases where some variables are undefined... so the
user may see the actual variable name if you use a variable in the
wrong place. The most problematic variable in this respect is
"\$VICTIM", which is descriptive but may cause minor panic.

You can keep variable evaluation from happening by escaping the
dollar sign, as in
  \\\$MAJORDOMO
which will appear as simply "\$MAJORDOMO" to the user.

See "help put" for information on how to change or create the various
files mentioned below, and for the meaning/use of each file.
