                 Substitution variables and file templates

When Majordomo sends a reply message in response to a request, the document
that it sends is usually a template.  The template may have one or more 
keyword variables, for which Majordomo automatically substitutes the 
appropriate value.  Substitution variables are composed of a leading
dollar sign, followed by capital letters and underscores.

For example, when you use the command
   help overview
The last line of the document says
   Majordomo 2, version \$VERSION
However, what you see on your screen is
   Majordomo 2, version $VERSION

Majordomo automatically substitutes the version number for the 
VERSION keyword variable.

The most important use of variable substitutions is in the faq, info,
and intro files that are available through the commands with the same
names.  Substitution variables are also used by some configuration
settings and by the announce and help commands.

Substitution variables are not the same as access rule variables.  See
"help access_variables" for more information about access variables.

As an example of a variable, using this string in a file
  \$MJ
will cause the the address of the majordomo email interface to be
inserted before the user sees the file contents.

When you edit a document that contains substitution variables, be
certain to leave enough space for the text that will replace each
variable.  Otherwise, some lines in the document may be longer than you
expected.

Variables that are not supported by a particular document or
configuration setting will remain unaltered.  See "help error_files",
"help format_files" and "help reply_files" for a list of documents and
the substitutions that they support.

The \$INCLUDE variable can be used to incorporate a separate document
into the current document.  This variable must be followed by a dash and
the location of a file within the file space of your mailing list.  For
example, the following substitution:

  \$INCLUDE-help/topics

will include the contents of the "help topics" document into the current
file.  The line that contains the substitution must end immediately
after the file location.  

Included files can also use the \$INCLUDE substitution, but more
than 3 levels of nesting is taken to be an infinite loop, which will
cause an error message to be displayed.

The \$INCLUDE substitution is supported by reply files, but not by error
files or format files.

If you misspell a variable, or use one that is not defined, it will
appear exactly as you typed it, including the dollar sign.

You can keep variable evaluation from happening by preceding the
dollar sign with a backslash, as in
  \\$MAJORDOMO
which will appear as simply "\$MAJORDOMO" after the substitutions are
finished.

In addition, the text can be padded and justified, as illustrated
in this example:
  \$LIST:-18 X \$COMMAND:11

The name of the mailing list is padded with spaces to at least 18 characters
and left-justified.  The command is padded to at least 11 characters and
right-justified.  If the mailing list name is "aardvark" and the command
is "subscribe" then this line would be displayed as
  aardvark           X   subscribe           

Padding in this manner is very useful for commands, such as who-enhanced,
that display a table of data with each column aligned properly.

See "help get" and "help put" for information on how to see, change,
or create the error, format, and reply files that use these substitutions.

Extensions for error and format files
-------------------------------------

Beyond the standard reply files, Majordomo comes with error and format
files that determine the output of the individual Majordomo commands.
Error files are used to display explanations when a command is 
incorrect, not permitted, or otherwise unavailable.  Format files
display the output of the individual commands, and vary depending
upon the interface.  Currently, the e-mail and mj_shell interfaces
use the "text" format files, whereas the web interfaces use
the "wwwadm" and "wwwusr" format files.

There are three extensions to the substitutions which are used
by the error and format files. 

1. A keyword variable prefixed with a question mark instead of a dollar
sign will cause the whole line to be omitted from the output
if the value is not set.

Example:
  The archive is available on the web at ?ARCURL


2. A substitution value that is actually an array of values will
cause the same line to be displayed multiple times, once for
each value in the array.  Other substitutions on the same line, which
only have one value, will be displayed only on the first line.

Example:
  \$LIST:-23 $DESCRIPTION

(This example is used by the lists command to display a list name and
a multiple-line description of the mailing list.  Although the list name 
only appears on the first line, a 23 space indentation appears on each 
succeeding line, which keeps the lines of the description aligned with
one another.)

3. The special \$HELP substitution, following by a colon and the name 
of a help page (in upper-case letters), will cause a hypertext link 
to that page to appear in the output of the WWW interfaces.  In the text 
formatting files, the variable is simply replaced by the name of the 
page, in lower-case letters.

Example:
  You may change your delivery class using the \$HELP:SET command.
