Only subscribers with the "replyto" personal setting will see this
header (see "help set" for more information on personal settings.)

The Reply-To header can also be altered using the delete_headers and
message_headers configuration settings.  The reply_to setting is more
flexible in that it does not always override existing headers.

The header text will undergo variable substitution when it is added to the
message.  These variables include the standard substitutions, plus HOST,
NEEDCOPY, SENDER, and SEQNO.  See "help variables" for a description of
these substitutions.
