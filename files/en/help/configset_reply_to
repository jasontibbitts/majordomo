EXAMPLE:
configset listname reply_to = $SENDER


Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing message.
NOTE: A pre-existing Reply-To: header (such as one added by the user's
mail tool) will NOT be replaced unless override_reply_to is true.

Another way to get reply-to headers is with "configset message_headers",
but that is normally done only for the GLOBAL pseudo-list. This command
is more flexible in that it can supply defaults but dissappear when
there is already such a header. Reply-To, no matter how it is supplied,
should override the Sender header.

The header text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to
the message. See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which
are supported.
