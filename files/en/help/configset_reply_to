Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing message.  If the
following strings appear here, they will be converted to the appropriate
text when the header is inserted into the message:

  $HOST   - the hostname of the server (from the resend_host variable)
  $LIST   - the name of the list
  $SENDER - the address of person who sent the message
  $SEQNO  - the message sequence number

Note that a preexisting Reply-To: header will not be replaced unless
override_reply_to is true.
