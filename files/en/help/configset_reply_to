# reply_to
# (undef)              [word] <resend>
# Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing message.  If the
# following strings appear here, they will be converted to the appropriate
# text when the header is inserted into the message:
#
#   \$HOST   - the hostname of the server (from the resend_host variable)
#   \$LIST   - the name of the list
#   \$SENDER - the address of person who sent the message
#   \$SEQNO  - the message sequence number
#
# Note that a preexisting Reply-To: header will not be replaced unless
# override_reply_to is true.
