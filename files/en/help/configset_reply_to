EXAMPLE:
configset listname reply_to = $SENDER

Majordomo adds a Reply-to header to posted messages with this value
if the value is set.  Only subscribers with the replyto setting
will see this header (see "help set" for more information).

NOTE: A pre-existing Reply-To: header (such as one added by the user's
mail tool) will NOT be replaced unless the override_reply_to configuration
setting has a true value.

Another way to get reply-to headers is with "configset message_headers",
but that is normally done only for the GLOBAL pseudo-list. The reply_to
setting is more flexible in that it does not always override existing
headers.

The header text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to
the message.  These variables include the standard substitutions, plus
HOST, SENDER, and SEQNO.  See "help variables" for a description of these
substitutions.
