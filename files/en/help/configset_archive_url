$INCLUDE-config/archive_url

If your mailing list has an internet-accessible archive that is not
maintained by Majordomo, the archive_url setting can be used to display
its location.  The location is usually a uniform resource locator for a
WWW page or FTP directory.

The archive_url location is displayed by the lists-full command.  It can
also be used in the message_headers configuration setting using the
ARCURL substitution variable.
