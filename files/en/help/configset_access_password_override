This controls whether or not the restrictions given in access_rules
can always be overridden with a password.  If this is set to no, then
a supplied password is just another variable that can be used in the
access table.

WARNING: use this variable with care.  It is possible to lock yourself
out of your lists if you do not grant some password access.
