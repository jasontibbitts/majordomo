# access_password_override
# (yes)                [bool] <access>
# This controls whether or not the restrictions given in access_rules
# can always be overridden with a password.  If this is set to no, then
# a supplied password is just another variable that can be used in the
# access table.
#
# WARNING: use this variable with care.  It is possible to lock yourself
# out of your lists if you do not grant some password access.
