EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL access_password_override = 1


This controls whether or not the restrictions given in access_rules
can always be overridden with a password.  If this is set to no, then
a supplied password is just another variable that can be used in the
access table.

When Majordomo checks the access for a request, it follows
three steps:

1. Password checks 
2. Access rule checks 
   (Using the access_rules setting)
3. Default rule checks 
   (Using settings like subscribe_policy and get_access)

If access_password_override is set to yes, a request which
uses a valid master password will be completed immediately at the
end of step 1; steps 2 and 3 are never taken.

If access_password_override is set to no, a request which
uses a valid master password will cause the access variable
"master_password" to be set to 1, after which steps 2 and,
if needed, 3 will be taken.

The following example shows how this setting might be useful.
Suppose a list owner would like to send invitations to participate
in a mailing list.  She stores a file called "greetings" in
her list's file space with the "put" command, then writes the 
following access rule:

subscribe
confirm=greetings
$master_password

This gives the list owner two ways to use the subscribe command
with her master password.  If access_password override is set to yes,
new subscribers will be added immediately.  If access_password_override
is set to no, they will be sent a confirmation notice (the "greetings" 
file) instead.

To make this feature more convenient, the "rule" command mode 
can be used to turn off the access_password_override setting
for the duration of one request.  In the example above, the
list owner could use the command
  subscribe mylist someone@example.com
to add someone immediately, and
  subscribe-rule mylist someone@example.com
to send the customized confirmation instead.

This setting has no influence on the accept, reject, sessioninfo,
showtokens, tokeninfo, configdef, configset, and configshow commands, 
which do not rely upon the access rules.
