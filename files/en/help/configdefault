Sets the variable back to the default value.  Note that this causes the
variable to track changes in the default value whenever they are made,
rather than just setting it to the current default value. This is
useful, for example, when the Majordomo defaults change and you want
to remove a workaround "configset".

The configuration settings for a mailing list are defined in
three ways.  First, for every domain served by Majordomo at
your site, there is a script named cf_defs_YOUR_DOMAIN.pl that
contains the default settings for every list.  Since this
file is overwritten every time Majordomo is upgraded, editing
that file is not recommended.  Instead, a site administrator
should use the configset command to change settings for the 
DEFAULT list.

Any change made to the DEFAULT list will override the value in
the defaults script, even if a variable is set to an undefined
value.  Likewise, any changes made with the configset command
for your list will override the values in either the defaults
script or the DEFAULT list. 
  
The difference between using configdefault to reset a variable
is not the same as setting the variable to the default value with
the configset command.  If you use the configdefault command,
the variable will change if your site administrators change the
default value.  If you use the configset command, the variable
will stay the same, regardless of any changes made to the DEFAULT
list.  

If you wish to reset the values of more than one variable, either
separate the variable names with commas, or use a here document.
For example,

configdefault YOUR_LIST who_access, intro_access, faq_access

is the same as

configdefault YOUR_LIST <<ENDTAG
who_access
intro_access
faq_access
ENDTAG

A complete list of variables is included in "help configset".
