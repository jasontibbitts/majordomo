Sets the variable back to the default value.  Note that this causes the
variable to track changes in the default value whenever they are made,
rather than just setting it to the current default value. This is
useful, for example, when the Majordomo defaults change and you want
to remove a workaround "configset".

Multiple variables cannot be defaulted at once (unlike configshow).

A complete list of variables is included in "help configset".
