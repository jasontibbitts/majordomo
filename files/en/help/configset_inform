Whenever a command is processed or a message is posted, Majordomo records
the result in a log.  It then examines the inform configuration setting
to see if anything else must be done.  This setting consists of zero or
more lines, with three fields on each line.  If the command matches the
criteria in the first two fields, the actions in the third field are
undertaken.

The first field on each line can be any Majordomo command, or any of the
following other events that are logged:  badtoken, bounce, connect,
consult, expire, newtoken, or parse.  See "help report" for a
description of each of these events.  The "help topics" document has a
list of all of the commands.

The second field on each line is one or more of these results:
  succeed  perform the actions if the request succeeds.
  fail     perform the actions if the request fails.
  stall    perform the actions if the request is stalled.
  all      always perform the actions

The third field on each line is one or more of these actions:
  ignore   completely ignore the request; this overrides the other actions.
  report   display the information when the "report-inform" command is used.
  inform   mail a summary of the event to the list owners.

All actions are logged; this setting only affects which actions are
deemed important enough to report.

It is possible for site or domain administrators to issue commands that
are not logged, using the "nolog" command mode.  It is also possible for
list administrators to issue commands that are not reported via e-mail,
using the "noinform" command mode.  See "help admin_commands" for more
details.

The "inform" command can apply to the GLOBAL pseudo-list or an actual 
list name, based on which events you want to observe. Some events, like
posted messages, do not occur on the GLOBAL list, while others, such
as the help command, are not applicable to ordinary mailing lists.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
lines in this setting.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.  You can 
use comments as a reminder of what a setting does or why it was chosen, 
but comments have no impact on how the setting works.
