$INCLUDE-config/inform

Whenever a command is processed or a message is posted, Majordomo records
the result in a log.  It then examines the inform configuration setting
to see if anything else must be done.  This setting consists of zero or
more lines, with three fields on each line.  If the command matches the
criteria in the first two fields, the actions in the third field are
undertaken.

The first field on each line can be any Majordomo command, or any of the
following other events that are logged:  badtoken, bounce, connect,
consult, expire, newtoken, parse, probebounce, or tokenbounce.  See
"help report" for a description of each of these events.  The "help
topics" document has a list of all of the commands.

The second field on each line is one or more of these results:
  succeed  perform the actions if the request succeeds.
  fail     perform the actions if the request fails.
  stall    perform the actions if the request is stalled.
  all      always perform the actions

The third field on each line is one or more of these actions:
  ignore   completely ignore the request; this overrides the other actions.
  report   display the information when the "report-inform" command is used.
  inform   mail a summary of the event to the list owners.

The inform setting has no influence on which events are recorded in the
log.  It only affects the output of the report command, and the delivery
of e-mail notices to the administrators when certain events occur.

Some events, such as the accept, reject, and tokeninfo commands, do not
apply to ordinary mailing lists, and can only be reported to domain
administrators.  

The "inform" action will usually cause a short notice to be mailed to
the list owners.  This notice contains a summary of the event, including
the command line, who issued the command, the status of the command, and
the session number of the command.  See "help sessioninfo" for more
information about sessions.

For the "reject" and "tokenbounce" events, the "inform" action causes a
detailed message to be sent to the list owners.  The message for the
reject event contains the complete session information for the command
that was rejected, to allow the owners to determine who was responsible
for the original command.  The message for the tokenbounce event
contains the error message that indicates why a confirmation message
could not be delivered.  See "help admin_moderate" for more information
about confirmation tokens.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
lines in this setting.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.  You can 
use comments as a reminder of what a setting does or why it was chosen, 
but comments have no impact on how the setting works.


                    Notes for domain administrators

It is possible for site or domain administrators to issue commands that
are not logged, using the "nolog" command mode.  It is also possible for
list or domain administrators to issue commands that are not reported
via e-mail, using the "noinform" command mode.  See "help admin_commands"
for more details.

The log for a domain is stored in the "_log" file, in the directory for
the GLOBAL pseudo-list.
