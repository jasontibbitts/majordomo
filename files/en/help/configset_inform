# inform
# (empty)              [inform] <inform>
# This controls just what actions the list owner will be informed of and
# what will be logged.  The format of each line is:
#
# request | status | actions
#
# where request is subscribe, lists, post, etc., status is a comma
# separated list of:
#
#   succeed: perform the actions if the request succees.
#   fail:    perform the actions if the request fails.
#   stall:   perform the actions if the request is stalled.
#   all:     always perform the actions
#
# and actions is a comma separated list of:
#
#   ignore: completelu ignore the request
#   report: log the request for later reposting
#   inform: inform the owner immediately
#
# ignore overrides the others.
#
# If a request is not specified, the default behavior for subscribe and
# unsubscribe is to inform on success, report otherwise.  The default
# behavior for all other requests is to report always.  This
# approximates the 1.9x behavior.
#
# Note that all actions are logged; this only affects which actions are
# deemed important enough to send mail about and which will be reported.

addendum to Majordomo2 "configset inform" File - updated 7 Mar 99

This command specifies the commands or actions which should result in
notices being sent to the list owner or site administrator, and/or
what will be logged (the log file is probably in the /tmp or /var/mj
or a similar directory - see "help configset tmpdir_GLOBAL" for how
to change or set this directory).

Every command that Majordomo knows how to process can be the target
of an inform command. In addition, you can use "post" as a "request"
item even though it is not a Majordomo command.

A complete list of all "request"s can be retrieved by sending these
two commands to $MJ
   help admin commands
   help user commands
or just send
   help topics
and ignore all the configset sub-options.

Note that the "inform" command can apply to the GLOBAL pseudo-list or
an actual listname, based on which "request" you want to observe. Some
requests don't make sense for the GLOBAL list (like "post"), while
others don't make sense for a real list (like "help").

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

For a list of topics, or this text, send one of the next two lines
   help topics
   help configset_inform
to the server at $MJ
