EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL inform << ENDTAG
subscribe | all | inform
post | fail | inform
set | all | inform
ENDTAG


This controls just what actions the list owner will be informed of and
what will be logged.  The format of each line is:
  request | status | actions
where request is any Mj2 command (like subscribe, lists, post, etc.),
status is a comma separated list of "succeed, fail, stall, all", and
actions is a comma separated list of "ignore, report, inform". The full
syntax is described in "help configset inform".

1. The request field can be any command that Majordomo knows how to
process. In addition, you can use "post" as a "request" item even
though it is not actually a Majordomo command. A complete list of all
"request"s can be retrieved by sending these two commands to $MJ
   help commands
   help admin commands
or just send
   help topics
and ignore all the configset sub-options.

2. The status field is a comma separated list of these results:
  succeed: perform the actions if the request succees.
  fail:    perform the actions if the request fails.
  stall:   perform the actions if the request is stalled.
  all:     always perform the actions

3. The actions field is a comma separated list of what to do:
  ignore: completelu ignore the request (overrides the others!)
  report: log the request for later reposting (not implemented)
  inform: inform the owner immediately (via email)

If a request is not specified, the default behavior for subscribe and
unsubscribe is to inform on success, report otherwise.  The default
behavior for all other requests is to report always.  This
approximates the 1.9x behavior.

Note that all actions are logged; this only affects which actions are
deemed important enough to send mail about and which will be reported.

This command specifies the commands or actions which should result in
notices being sent to the list owner or site administrator, and/or
what will be logged (the log file is probably in the /tmp or /var/mj
or a similar directory - see "help configset tmpdir" for how
to change or set this directory).

Note that the "inform" command can apply to the GLOBAL pseudo-list or
an actual listname, based on which "request" you want to observe. Some
requests don't make sense for the GLOBAL list (like "post"), while
others don't make sense for a real list (like "help").


For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
