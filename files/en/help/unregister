The "register" command adds an "address" to the registration database
without adding it to any lists. When an address is first subscribed to
any list at this site, it is automatically put in the registration
database. Unregistering will automatically remove that address from all
lists at this site.

A confirmation token will be sent to the given "address" to verify
this action, and must be replied to with an "accept" command, unless
an authorized password is used with "approve".
