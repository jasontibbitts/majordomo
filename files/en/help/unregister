address, if specified, is an e-mail address that is already registered.

The unregister command will remove one or more e-mail addresses from the
registration database.  All of the subscriptions and aliases belonging
to an address that is unregistered will be removed automatically.

The simplest way for you to unregister is to send the following command
in the body of an e-mail message to $MJ:
  unregister
(A confirmation message may be sent to your e-mail address.)

If the address from which you are sending the message is different from
the address that is registered, use the following command:
  unregister ADDRESS
(Substitute the e-mail address you wish to unregister for ADDRESS.)


                        Notes for administrators

Patterns
--------
If the "pattern" command mode is used, you must specify a pattern on the
command line.  See "help patterns" for an introduction Majordomo
matching pattern.  A domain or site administrative password is required
to use the "pattern" mode.  The "regex" mode is identical to the
"pattern" mode.

If the "allmatching" command mode is also used, every address that
matches the pattern will be unregistered.  Otherwise, only the
first address that matches the pattern will be removed.


Pattern examples
----------------
The following command will remove the first address that matches
"example.net" from the registry:

  unregister-pattern example.net


The following command will remove every address that matches
"example.edu" from the registry:

  unregister-pattern-allmatching example.edu


The following command will remove all of the addresses from the
registration database, along with all of their subscriptions and
aliases:

  unregister-pattern-allmatching ALL


Canonical Addresses
-------------------
Each address has an original and a canonical form.  Usually these
addresses are the same, but if the original address (the one that was
used to subscribe to a mailing list or register) is an alias for another
address, the latter address is the canonical address.

When the "pattern" mode is used, the canonical addresses are compared to
the pattern.  This may cause some surprising results when an original
address that does not match the pattern is reported to have been
unregistered.


Here documents
--------------
List owners can unregister more than one address or pattern using a
"here document".  For example, to unregister the addresses
"a@example.com" and "b@example.com", a domain administrator could use
the following command:

unregister <<ABC
a@example.com
b@example.com
ABC

See "help here_document for more details.


It is only possible to unregister an invalid address using the
"pattern" or "regex" command mode.  Registered addresses can become
invalid, for example, if the GLOBAL configuration settings that affect
the validity of e-mail addresses are made stricter.
