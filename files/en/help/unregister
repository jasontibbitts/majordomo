address, required, is a previously registered address
-regexp, if specified, makes address a pattern (see "help patterns")
-allmatching, if specified, operates on every address that matches

The "register" command adds an "address" to the registration database
without adding it to any lists. When an address is first subscribed to
any list at this site, it is automatically put in the registration
database. Unregistering will automatically remove that address from all
lists at this site.

Unless the command is "approve"d in advance, a confirmation token will
be sent to the given "address" to verify this action, and must be replied
to with an "accept" command. Users can pre-approve unregistering
individual addresses, but the site password is required for "-regexp".

When -regexp is used to unregister addresses with wild cards, the site
password is required and confirmations will not be requested. Without
"-allmatching", only the first matching address is removed.

If the "-allmatching" option is used with "-regexp", then every
address that matches the pattern will be removed from the registry
(and automatically unsubscribed from every list).
