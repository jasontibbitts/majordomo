Example:
  info test-list
 
The info command displays an Information file for a mailing list, if one
exists. 

The "info" document is included in the welcome message that is received
by new subscribers when they join a mailing list.  List owners can
use different documents in welcome messages by adjusting the
welcome_files configuration setting.

The info document supports variable substitutions (see "help variables" 
for more details).  

The "edit" command mode is designed to allow list owners
to edit and replace the existing document easily.  For example,
the command:
  info-edit test-list

would display the contents of the info document wrapped in a "newinfo"
command:

newinfo test-list <<ADGBEH

To post to the mailing list, send a message to 
  \$WHOAMI

If you have questions about the test list, please write to
  \$OWNER

ADGBEH

Please see "help here_document" and "help newinfo" for more information
on replacing the info document.
