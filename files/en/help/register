EXAMPLES:
register Joe Blow <joe@example.org>
register-password JoesPassword Joe Blow <joe@example.org>

The "register" command will add an e-mail address to the registration
database without subscribing it to any mailing lists.

Unless "pass" mode is used, Majordomo will invent a password for the
e-mail address.

If "pass" mode is used, you must specify a password.   The password must
not contain tabs or spaces.  The password must be at least $PWLENGTH
characters long.

If "welcome" mode is used, or if the GLOBAL "welcome" setting is turned
on, a welcome message will be sent to the e-mail address that is being
registered.  The "nowelcome" command mode will prevent the message from
being sent.

The e-mail address need not be a simple email address.  Comment fields are
preserved in the registration database. These examples are all valid
examples of the same address, but with different comment fields:

   joe@example.com
   Joe Blow <joe@example.com>
   "Joe Blow 555-1212" <joe@example.com>
   Joe Blow <joe@example.com> (555-1212)
   joe@example.com (Joe Blow)

Registering with a name or other comment is not required, but it may
help a site administrator find your address in the event you need help
later.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, your address will be registered
automatically, if it is not already registered.

To learn how to change your registered e-mail address and all of your
subscriptions to a new address, see "help changeaddr".

To learn how to change your password, see "help password".

Domain administrators should see "help configset_welcome" and 
"help configset_welcome_files" for more information about welcome
messages.
