address,     required,     is a previously unregistered address

-password,   if specified, takes the first arg as the new password
newpassword, if specified, is the initial password for address

The "register" command adds an "address" to the registration database
without adding it to any lists. It is possible to register, get a
password, and then use "approve" to subscribe to several lists instead
of using "accept" to confirm each subscription.

NOTE: There is, as of 1/99, no formal way to review the register or
      alias databases. Please contact the maintainer shown at the
      bottom of this file for a Perl script that assumes shell access.

You may either use the "-password" option OR use "newpassword", not
both. If you use "-password" but don't put "newpassword" between the
option and the address, Majordomo will grab the first word of your
address for use as the password (and the command may fail).

Unless the "-password" option is used, Majordomo will invent one and
send it to "address" with a request for confirmation.

Unless the "-nowelcome" option is used, Majordomo will send a message
to "address" with an explanation of how to use the password.

When an address is first subscribed to any list at this site, it is
automatically put in the registration database and the register command
can not be used until that address is unregistered. Unregistering will
automatically remove that address from all lists at this site.

The address need not be a simple email address. Comment fields are
preserved in the registration database. These are all valid addresses:
   joe@blow.com
   Joe Blow <joe@blow.com>
   "Joe Blow 555-1212" joe@blow.com
   joe@blow.com (Joe Blow)
Note that registering with a name or other comment field is not
required, but it may help a site administrator find your address
in the event you need help later.

In addition, other technically illegal addresses can be used
but only if the site administrator has enabled them. See these
help files for details:
   help configset addr_allow_at_in_phrase
   help configset addr_allow_bang_paths
   help configset addr_allow_comments_after_route
   help configset addr_allow_ending_dot

A confirmation token will be sent to the given "address" to verify
this action, and must be replied to with an "accept" command before
the registration is completed and the password can be used.

See Also:
   help configset access_rules_variables (set/test for this command)
   help password   (which changes an individual's password)
   help subscribe  (does an automatic registration)
   help unregister (which removes an address from the database)
