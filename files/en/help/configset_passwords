addendum to Majordomo2 "configset passwords" File - updated 25 Feb 99

NOTE: This command applies to SUBSIDIARY LIST PASSWORDS only!
(to be used by list owners to delegate tasks, not by list subscribers)

Refer to "help password" for personal passwords for subscribers to
use and "help configset master_password" for the overall list and
site passwords.

The "passwords" setting provides passwords that have limited permissions
and they can be bound to certain email addresses for a bit of added
security. They are very useful for delegation of list management tasks
without releasing the overall list password. The person with the overall
list password (the "master_password") can replace that password or any
of the subsidiary passwords at will.

For example, to give Joe Blow to subscribe other people to your list
and Jane Doe the ability to remove them:

default password MASTERPASSWORD
configset LISTNAME passwords <<ENDPASSWORDS
  SUBSCRIBEPASSWORD :   subscribe :  joe@blow.com
UNSUBSCRIBEPASSWORD : unsubscribe : jane@doe.com
ENDPASSWORDS

Be sure to use real passwords and real list names. You can use the
"default" syntax or the "approve" syntax to supply the list's master
password.

The list of actions which can be protected by subsidiary passwords
has not been documented as of 1/99. It is anticipated that all commands
shown in "help topics" can be the subject of "passwords" settings. It is
also anticipated that the GLOBAL pseudo-list can be named in "passwords"
as a way of allowing selective site management tasks.
