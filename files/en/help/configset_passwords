A table of passwords, the actions they allow a user to perform, and an
optional list of user names which they are bound to.  The table should
look like so:

  password1 : action, action, action
  password2 : action, action : user@host.dom, blah@urk.org

If no users are listed, the password can be used by all users.  Any
addresses listed are put through the transformation and aliasing
processes before being used.

The following actions are permitted:

  config_xyz - allows the user to view and alter the contents of
    config variables in the group "xyz".

 XXX List all of the actions here!
NOTE: This command applies to SUBSIDIARY LIST PASSWORDS only!
(to be used by list owners to delegate tasks, not by list subscribers)

Refer to "help password" for personal passwords for subscribers to
use and "help configset master_password" for the overall list and
site passwords.

The "passwords" setting provides passwords that have limited permissions
and they can be bound to certain email addresses for a bit of added
security. They are very useful for delegation of list management tasks
without releasing the overall list password. The person with the overall
list password (the "master_password") can replace that password or any
of the subsidiary passwords at will.

For example, to give Joe Blow to subscribe other people to your list
and Jane Doe the ability to remove them:

default password MASTERPASSWORD
configset LISTNAME passwords <<ENDPASSWORDS
  SUBSCRIBEPASSWORD :   subscribe :  joe@blow.com
UNSUBSCRIBEPASSWORD : unsubscribe : jane@doe.com
ENDPASSWORDS

Be sure to use real passwords and real list names. You can use the
"default" syntax or the "approve" syntax to supply the list's master
password.

The list of actions which can be protected by subsidiary passwords
has not been documented as of 1/99. It is anticipated that all commands
shown in "help topics" can be the subject of "passwords" settings. It is
also anticipated that the GLOBAL pseudo-list can be named in "passwords"
as a way of allowing selective site management tasks.
