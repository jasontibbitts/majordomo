$INCLUDE-config/passwords

The following actions are permitted:
  commands for all lists:  announce, archive, digest, faq, get, index, info, 
    intro, post, put, report, set, showtokens, subscribe, unsubscribe, which, 
    who.

  commands for the GLOBAL pseudo-list: alias, changeaddr, createlist, help,
    lists, password, register, rekey, unalias, unregister.
    
  advertise - allows the administrator to see the mailing list in the output
    of the "lists" command.

  config_XYZ - allows the administrator to view and alter the contents of
    configuration settings in the category "XYZ".  See "help configshow" for
    a list of configuration categories.  Categories are always written in
    capital letters.

  config_xyz - allows the administrator to view and alter the contents of
    the configuration setting named "xyz".  See "help topics" for a complete
    list of configuration settings.

  config_ALL - allows the administrator to view and alter any configuration
    setting.

  ALL - allows the administrator to issue any command.
     
The "passwords" setting provides administrative passwords that have limited 
privileges.  For ordinary mailing lists, these passwords have level 1, the
lowest of the password levels.  For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, these passwords
have level 3 and apply to every mailing list (see "help admin_passwords" for
a discussion of password levels).

These passwords can be bound to certain e-mail addresses for added security. 
Each address is subject to the aliasing and transformation process.
(See "help alias" and "help configset_addr_xforms" for more information).
They are very useful for delegation of list management tasks without releasing
the list's master password. The person with the master password can replace 
that password or any of the subsidiary passwords at will.

For example, to give joe@example.com the ability to subscribe other people
to your mailing list, and jane@example.net the ability to remove them, use
this command:

configset LISTNAME passwords <<ENDPASSWORDS
  SUBPW :   subscribe : joe@example.com
UNSUBPW : unsubscribe : jane@example.net
ENDPASSWORDS

(Substitute the name of a valid mailing list for LISTNAME, and 
actual passwords for SUBPW and UNSUBPW).

Changing this setting will cause each password to become encrypted.
Encrypted passwords are 27 characters long.  Once the password is encrypted, 
there is no way to discover the original password if it is forgotten; 
you will have to change the password to a new value.

Either a colon ':' or pipe '|' can be used to separate a password from
the list of actions.  Therefore, the password itself cannot contain a colon
or pipe character.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
As a consequence, a password cannot begin with '#'.  You can use comments 
as a reminder of what a password does or why it was chosen, but comments 
have no impact on how the password works.
