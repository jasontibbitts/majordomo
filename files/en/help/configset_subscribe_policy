EXAMPLE:
configset listname subscribe_policy = closed


WARNING: Using "open" alone is not safe: Many mail tools allow easy
         forgery of the "From" field, so an "open" policy allows
         anyone to subscribe anyone else to your list! The "auto"
         setting allows the same thing without even faking the From
         field. The default setting (open+confirm) allows anyone to
         start the process, but it must be confirmed by the 'victim'.

$INCLUDE-config/subscribe_policy

This setting determines who can use the subscribe command to participate
in a mailing list.  It has no effect upon auxiliary lists.

An administrative password can be used to issue the subscribe command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the subscribe command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
