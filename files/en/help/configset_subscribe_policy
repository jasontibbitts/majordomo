# subscribe_policy     /open,closed,auto,open+confirm,closed+confirm,auto+confirm/
# (open+confirm)       [enum] <majordomo,access,subscribe>
# One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
# '+confirm'.  Open allows people to subscribe themselves to the list,
# but attempts to subscribe addresses diferent than where the request is
# coming from will require approval.  Auto allows anybody to subscribe
# anybody to the list without maintainer approval.  Closed requires
# maintainer approval for all subscribe requests to the list.  Adding
# '+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send a reply
# back to the subscriber which includes a authentication number which
# must be sent back in with another subscribe command.
