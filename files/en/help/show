The "show" command provides the following information:

 - Whether or not the given address is legal
 - The mailbox and comment, extracted from the address
 - What the address transforms to, under the various address equivalencies
 - Any aliases attached to the address
 - Any lists the address is subscribed to
 - The time the address was registered
 - The time the registration data was last updated
 - For each list the address is subscribed to:
      - What address is receiving the list mail
      - The time that the address was subscribed to the list
      - The subscription class
      - The subscriber flags
      - The time the record was last updated

The 'show' command allows the display if the requested address and the
requesting address are the same; otherwise, a token is generated and
the requested address must issue an "accept" command.
