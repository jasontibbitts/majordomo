EXAMPLE:
configset listname description_long << ENDTAG
This is my very fine list!
You can read all about it by sending 'info listname' to the server.
ENDTAG


This is the list description that appears in the long listing.  Each line
should be no longer than 50 characters in order to fit on the average
terminal.  If this variable is empty, the value of 'description' is used.
If both are empty, the string "(no description)" is used.
