$INCLUDE-config/description_long

If this setting is empty, the contents of the description setting will
be displayed by the lists command.  If both settings are empty, 
"(no description)" will be displayed.

The length of the description may be limited by the
description_max_lines configuration setting.  By default, there is no
limit.
