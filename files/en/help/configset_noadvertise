The noadvertise and advertise configuration settings will be 
overridden by access rules for the "advertise" action.

If the GLOBAL advertise_subscribed setting is turned on, a
mailing list will be displayed by the lists command if the
person making the request is subscribed to the list.  This
is true regardless of the value of the noadvertise setting.

Here are the access_rules that implement the same functionality as
advertise and noadvertise:

configset LISTNAME access_rules <<ENDACCESSRULES
advertise
allow
/some pattern/ || /another pattern/

advertise
deny
/evil pattern/

advertise
allow
ALL
ENDACCESSRULES
