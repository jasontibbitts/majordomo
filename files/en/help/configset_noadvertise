EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL noadvertise << ENDTAG
/hotbot/i
ENDTAG


If the requestor name matches one of these regexps, then the list will
not be listed in the output of a lists command.  Noadvertise overrides
advertise.
If address matches in 'noadvertise', the list will not be shown unless
there is a specific reason to show it.

NOTE: If address matches in 'advertise', the list will be shown no
matter what settings are in place for 'noadvertise'.

NOTE: If the requester is a subscriber to the list, the list will be
shown no matter what settings are in place for 'noadvertise'.

You can probably see that this is more easily handled by access_rules,
but the advertise pair is there for backwards compatibility. You don't
need to specify both access_rules and advertise, either one will work!

Here are the access_rules that implement the same functionality as
advertise and noadvertise:

configset LISTNAME access_rules <<ENDACCESSRULES
advertise
allow
/some pattern/ || /another pattern/

advertise
deny
/evil pattern/

advertise
allow
ALL
ENDACCESSRULES
