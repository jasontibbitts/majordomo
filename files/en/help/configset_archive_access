EXAMPLE:
configset listname archive_access = open


One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members access, while closed completely
disables the command for everyone. Archives are accessed with either the
'archive-index' and 'archive-get' commands, or with 'index' and 'get'.

 The "get" command can be used for files which
are also available via "faq", "info", etc., depending on how your file
system is configured, and get_access does NOT restrict use of those other
ways to retrieve special files.

One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members to get post archive files associated
with the named list, while closed completely disables the "archive-get" and
"archive-index" commands for everyone. The "get" command can be used for
files which are also available via "archive-get", depending on how your file
system is configured, and archive_access does NOT restrict use of "get".


This functionality of this variable is completely encapsulated within
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists because it's simpler to use.
