EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/archive_access

This setting determines who can use the archive command to retrieve
messages that have been posted to a mailing list in the past.  The
archive normally resides in a list's public file space, and therefore
can also be accessed by the get and index commands.  If the archive_dir
configuration setting is used to store the archive outside of the list's 
file space, the get and index commands cannot be used to access it.

An administrative password can be used to issue the archive command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the archive command  
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
