EXAMPLE:
configset listname subscribe_policy = open


One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members access, while closed completely
disables the command for everyone. Archives are accessed with either the
'archive-index' and 'archive-get' commands, or with 'index' and 'get'.

This functionality of archive_access is completely encapsulated in
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists for backwards compatibility
and because it's simpler to use.
