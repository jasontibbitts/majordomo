Triggers are actions that occur periodically.  Each trigger consists 
of a name and a set of times during which the trigger is issued.  
The name and times are separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons, as in:
  session  | monday(6,12,18), thursday(8)

When the software was installed, a cron job should have been set up to
call the mj_trigger program on an hourly basis.  During the hourly
cron job, the times for each trigger in the triggers setting are
compared to the current day and time.  Triggers whose times match
the current time are executed by the mj_trigger program.

Here are the actions which can be triggered via the GLOBAL pseudo-list:
 checksum - Expire posted message checksums and message-id data.
 delay    - Complete delayed requests.
 log      - Expire entries from the main log.
 session  - Expire old session data.
 token    - Issue reminders and remove expired tokens and temporary passwords.

Here are the actions which can be triggered via the regular lists:
 bounce   - Expire subscriber data, such as bounces and vacation settings.
 checksum - Expire posted message checksums and message-id data.
 delay    - Complete delayed requests and post delayed messages.
 post     - Expire data from the "post_limits" database.

NOTE: A value for each action in the "triggers" setting is required!

The times field follows the standard Majordomo syntax (see "help times").
"always" and "hourly" are identical:  the specified trigger is always run.  
"never" skips the specified trigger.

In addition to the named triggers, commands in files in the private
file space of a list can be run.  The file name must start with
a solidus, /.  The file must not reside in the public or help directory.
The commands in the file will undergo variable substitution using
the standard substitutions before they are run (see "help variables" for
more details).  For example, within a file, the commands
  default user \$OWNER
  lists-full \$LIST
would contain the actual list owners' address and list name when the
commands are run.  

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
triggers, Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.  You can use 
comments as a reminder of what a trigger does or why it was chosen, 
but comments have no impact on how the triggers work.
