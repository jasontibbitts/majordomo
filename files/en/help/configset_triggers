Triggers are used to send reminders and to remove expired data from
the databases.  Each trigger consists of a name and a set of times
during which the trigger is issued.  The data are separated by
vertical bars ('|') or colons, as in:
  session  | monday(6,12,18), thursday(8)

Here are the available actions which can be triggered:
 bounce   - Expire subscriber data, such as bounces and vacation settings.
 checksum - Expire posted message checksums and message-id data.
 delay    - Do things indicated by delay tokens or delay access rules.
 log      - Expire entries from the main log.
 post     - Expire data from the "post_limits" database.
 session  - Expire old session data.
 token    - Issue reminders and remove expired tokens and temporary passwords.

When the software was installed, a cron job should have been set up to
call mj_trigger periodically. The suggested setting is to do this on an
hourly basis ONLY, to avoid doing the same thing multiple times. When
that cron job triggers a check of various time-based actions, any
action which is due or overdue will be performed. Digests are ALWAYS
checked during the hourly trigger.

The times field follows the standard Majordomo syntax (see "help times").
Note the special cases of "always" which issues the specified trigger
whenever cron runs ANY trigger, and "never" which skips the specified trigger.
