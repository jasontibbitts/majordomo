The four commands ".", "exit", "quit", and "stop" are equivalent to "end".

The "end" command stops reading Majordomo commands from an email message,
or terminates the mj_shell interactive interface. When parsing email,
Majordomo will also stop if it finds a line that matches the
"configset GLOBAL signature_separator" command (by default this is
any line starting with a dash or an underscore).

The "end" command is a way to ignore automatically inserted signature
blocks, but remember that you MUST NOT allow any text to be inserted
at the top of your email message when you send commands to Majordomo.

==> see also: configset signature_separator_GLOBAL (for another way to end parsing)
