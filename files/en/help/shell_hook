                             The Shell Hook

In certain situations, Majordomo will call an external script or program
which perform a specialized task.  The programming technique that makes
this possible is called a "shell hook."  To make use of a shell hook,
place a script or program with the name of the shell hook in the
"scripts" directory where Majordomo is installed.

bouncehandler-unsubscribe
-------------------------
The bouncehandler-unsubscribe hook is invoked when the bounce_rules
setting requires that an address be removed from a mailing list without
sending a probe message or consulting the list moderators.  The script
is passed three parameters:  the domain name, the list name, and the
e-mail address that was removed from the list.  Majordomo will not
process the output of this script or program.

createlist-regen
----------------
The createlist-regen hook is invoked whenever the createlist command is
run successfully.  The script is passed one parameter:  the domain name.
Majordomo will not process the output of this script or program.

inform
------
The inform hook is invoked immediately after a completed command has
been recorded in the log.  The script is passed eleven parameters:

  *  The Majordomo domain
  *  The name of the mailing list
  *  The name of the command (e.g., subscribe)
  *  The e-mail address that issued the command
  *  The e-mail address affected by the command
  *  The full command line (e.g., unsubscribe LISTNAME joe@example.com)
  *  The interface from which the command was issued
  *  The status (1 for succeed, 0 for fail, -1 for stall)
  *  Password status (1 if a password was used; 0 otherwise)
  *  An explanation of what happened (usually only present if the 
     command stalled or failed)
  *  The time taken by the command (in seconds)
