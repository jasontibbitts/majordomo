                             The Shell Hook

In certain situations, Majordomo will call an external script or program
which perform a specialized task.  The programming technique that makes
this possible is called a "shell hook."  To make use of a shell hook,
place a script or program with the name of the shell hook in the
"scripts" directory where Majordomo is installed.

bouncehandler-unsubscribe
-------------------------
The bouncehandler-unsubscribe hook is invoked when the bounce_rules
setting requires that an address be removed from a mailing list without
sending a probe message or consulting the list moderators.  The script
is passed three parameters:  the domain name, the list name, and the
e-mail address that was removed from the list.  Majordomo will not
process the output of this script or program.

createlist-regen
----------------
The createlist-regen hook is invoked whenever the createlist command is
run successfully.  The script is passed one parameter:  the domain name.
Majordomo will not process the output of this script or program.
