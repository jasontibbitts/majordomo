searchstring, required, is an email address fragment you wish to find
-regexp, if specified, makes searchstring a pattern (see "help patterns")
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The "which" command returns all subscribers to all lists that have
the "searchstring" you specified as part of their email address, if
you are authorized to review the subscribers (not the real names that
may be in comment fields, just the simple email addresses).

Each list owner may decide who is authorized to use this command,
and you will receive an error message if you have been refused access.

If the "-regexp" option is used, "searchstring" is interpreted as a
Majordomo matching pattern. Review the "help patterns" file carefully.
Patterns can be very simple or full-blown Perl regular expressions.

Without the "-regexp" option, "searchstring" is matched literally
with no interpretation of special characters. Matching is case sensitive.

Which can return a huge amount of data, so be as specific as possible
when choosing the string to search for. Matches may be case sensitive,
so if "Joe" does not match, try "joe" instead.
