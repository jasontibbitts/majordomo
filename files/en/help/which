pattern, if specified, will be matched against e-mail addresses

The which command will search all of the lists at this domain for
subscribers whose e-mail addresses match the pattern on the command
line.  If no pattern is supplied, the subscriber databases will be
searched for the address of the person who made the command.

If a pattern is supplied, it must follow the rules for patterns
described in the "help patterns" document.  By default, a
case-insensitive substring search will be performed.  The search only
takes the actual e-mail address into consideration; comments in
addresses, such as a subscriber's full name, will not be searched.

By default, anyone who uses the which command without a site or domain
administrative password will be limited to one match per mailing list.
Because of this limitation, you should choose a search pattern that is
as specific as possible.

Because "which" is a global command, attempting to use it with a
password that is specific to one mailing list will result in an "Invalid
password" error.

The administrators of a mailing list can increase the default number of
matches allowed with the access_rules configuration setting.  See 
"help configset_access_rules" for more details.
