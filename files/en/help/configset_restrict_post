$INCLUDE-config/restrict_post

In the examples that follow, substitute the name of your mailing list
wherever you see LISTNAME.

To allow posted messages from the subscribers of the LISTNAME mailing
list, use the following value:
  LISTNAME

To allow posted messages from the members of an auxiliary list
(sublist), use the name of the sublist.  For example, to allow messages
from members of the "moderators" sublist, use the following value:
  moderators
See "help auxiliary_list" for an introduction to sublists.

To allow posted messages from subscribers from another mailing list,
follow the list name with a colon.  For example, to allow messages from
members of the "rodent" mailing list, use the following value:
  rodent:

To allow posted messages from members of an auxiliary list of another
mailing list, separate the list name and sublist name with a colon.  For
example, to allow messages from members of the "squirrel" sublist of the
"rodent" mailing list, use the following value:
  rodent:squirrel

If the value you give this setting occupies only one line, more than one
list or sublist can be placed on that line, with spaces or tabs between
the individual lists or sublists.  This format is supported for backward
compatibility.  If multiple lines are used, only one list or sublist
should be included on each line.  This is illustrated in two examples
near the beginning of this document.

If the value of this setting is empty, no restrictions will be imposed.

This setting can be overridden by rules for the post command in the
access_rules configuration setting.


Majordomo 1 compatibility
-------------------------
Majordomo 1 required that addresses be kept in a separate file.
Majordomo 2 requires that addresses be subscribed to mailing lists or to
auxiliary lists.

In Majordomo 1, regular and digest lists were separate; in Majordomo 2
they have been combined.  For backward compatibility, the following
values in the restrict_post setting are considered equivalent, and refer
to the subscribers of the LISTNAME mailing list:
  LISTNAME
  LISTNAME:
  LISTNAME.digest
  LISTNAME-digest
  LISTNAME_digest

In Majordomo 1, the following setting would restrict messages from
people who are neither subscribers nor are listed in the LISTNAME.allow
file:
  restrict_post = LISTNAME LISTNAME.allow

In Majordomo 2, the following command would restrict messages from
people who are neither subscribers nor are members of the "allow"
auxiliary list:
  configset LISTNAME restrict_post = LISTNAME allow
