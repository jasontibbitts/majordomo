# (empty)              [restrict_post] <resend,access>
#
# If defined only addresses belonging to one of the listed sublists will
# be allowed to post to the list.  This variable's function is
# completely encapsulated within the access_rules mechanism, but it
# remains for backwards compatibility and because it's simpler to use.
#
# This is an array variable, but for backwards compatibility the first
# item is split on spaces, tabs, and colons.
