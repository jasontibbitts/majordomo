If defined only addresses belonging to one of the listed sublists will
be allowed to post to the list.  This variable's function is
completely encapsulated within the access_rules mechanism, but it
remains for backwards compatibility and because it's simpler to use.

This is an array variable, but for backwards compatibility the first
item is split on spaces, tabs, and colons.
