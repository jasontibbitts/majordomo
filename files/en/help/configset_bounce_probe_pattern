EXAMPLE:
configset listname bounce_probe_pattern = /example\.com/i


If an address matches this pattern (see "help patterns"), it
will be probed for bounces each time mail goes through the list.
After one message, you can empty this variable because the
automated system will handle the rest.

If you get a bounce that the bounce handling system either can't parse or
can't get any implicated members from, or if you think (perhaps because you
know how to read bounces) that the bouncing address is in the "example.com"
domain, but you have seven members who are at example.com and you don't
just want to remove them all, you can put /example\.com/ or "example.com"
(with the quotes) in bounce_probe_pattern, wait for the next message, and the
bounces will be probed.  If you were right, the bouncing address will be
identified by the bounce parser and will automatically be probed until it
is removed or it stops bouncing.
