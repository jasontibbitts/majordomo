$INCLUDE-config/bounce_probe_pattern

If you get a bounce that the bounce handling system either can't parse or
can't get any implicated members from, or if you think (perhaps because you
know how to read bounces) that the bouncing address is in the "example.com"
domain, but you have seven members who are at example.com and you don't
just want to remove them all, you can put /example\.com/ or "example.com"
(with the quotes) in bounce_probe_pattern, wait for the next message, and the
addresses will be probed.  If you were right, the bouncing address will be
identified by the bounce parser and will automatically be probed until it
is removed or it stops bouncing.
