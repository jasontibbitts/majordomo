A string containing the flags to be given to new subscribers unless they
choose otherwise.  Possible flags are:
  A - ackall
  a - ackimportant
  C - eliminatecc
  H - hideall
  h - hideaddress
  P - prefix
  R - replyto
  S - selfcopy
  W - rewritefrom
NOTE: These supply defaults for new subscribers. Once subscribed, the
user can change their own settings on a per-list per-subscriber basis.

See "help set" for more information, including digest and nomail
settings, and a better description of what each option does.

These flags correspond to these "set" commands:
          A  - set listname ackall          EmailAddress
          a  - set listname ackimportant    EmailAddress
(no a, no A) - set listname noack           EmailAddress
          C  - set listname eliminatecc     EmailAddress
      (no C) - set listname noeliminatecc   EmailAddress
          H  - set listname hideall         EmailAddress
          h  - set listname hideaddress     EmailAddress
(no h, no H) - set listname nohide          EmailAddress
          P  - set listname prefix          EmailAddress
      (no P) - set listname noprefix        EmailAddress
          R  - set listname replyto         EmailAddress
      (no R) - set listname noreplyto       EmailAddress
          S  - set listname selfcopy        EmailAddress
      (no S) - set listname noselfcopy      EmailAddress
          W  - set listname rewritefrom     EmailAddress
      (no W) - set listname norewritefrom   EmailAddress
