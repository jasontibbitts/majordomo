EXAMPLE:
configset listname default_flags = SPR


A string containing the flags to be given to new subscribers unless they
choose otherwise. A list of all possible flags is contained in "help set".

NOTE: These supply defaults for new subscribers. Once subscribed, the
user can change their own settings on a per-list per-subscriber basis.

See "help set" for more information, including digest and nomail
settings, and a better description of what each option does.


See Also:
   help set       (for how a user can set these options after subscribing)
   help configset default_class   (controls subscription class of 'digest', 'each', etc)
   help configset allowed_flags   (restricts subscribers ability to use set)
   help configset nonmember_flags (sets non-subscriber defaults for ack messages)
