EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/archive_dir

In the examples that follow, substitute the name of your mailing list
wherever you see LISTNAME.

The "/public/archive" directory is normally created automatically when a
mailing list is created with the createlist command.  To see if this
directory exists, use the following command:

   index LISTNAME /public/archive

If the "/public/archive" directory does not exist, it can be created
with the following command:

   put-dir LISTNAME /public/archive List Archives

Refer to "help admin_documents", "help index", and "help put" for more 
information about the file space of your mailing list.

If you decide to change this setting, there are several criteria that
must be met:

  * You must specify the full path to the directory.  This requires
    that you have some knowledge about the file systems of the computer
    on which Majordomo is running.  The path must begin with a '/'.

  * The directory that you specify must already exist.  Majordomo will 
    not create it for you.

  * The Majordomo server must have sufficient credentials to create
    new files in the directory that you specify.

If you change the value of this setting, any existing archives will
remain in their current location.  

If you choose a directory that is outside the file space of your list,
the archive files will not be accessible with the index, get, and put
commands.

Messages that are stored in the archives are free of fronters, footers,
and other alterations that Majordomo usually makes to posted messages.

Majordomo will automatically create a ".index" directory under the
archive directory.  This ".index" directory is used to store database
files that allow the archive command to work properly.
