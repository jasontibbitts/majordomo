addendum to Majordomo2 "configset archive_dir" File - updated 26 Jan 99

There is normally NO NEED TO USE the archive_dir command!

Archives will start accumulating as soon as an "archive" directory appears
in the public area of the list's filespace.  This can be done by the command
   put-dir listname /public/archive List Archives
(properly approved with the appropriate password, of course). Refer to
"help put" for more details.

Archives will also start accumulating as soon as the archive_dir variable is
set and the directory exists with the right protections, but using "put-dir"
to create the directory in the default location is easier.

There is no need to create additional aliases. Archives are free of fronters,
footers, most header modifications and subject prefixing. The archive system
will automatically create a ".index" directory to contain various indices.
