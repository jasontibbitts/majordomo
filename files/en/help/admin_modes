Every Majordomo command supports five administrative command modes.
These modes are:
  noinform  - Do not mail a notice to the list owners.
  nolog     - Do not record this command in the log.
  nomessage - Do not mail the results if the "default user" command
              has been used.  See "help default" for more information.
  quiet     - Do not send a notice if the command is delayed.
  rule      - Act as if the "access_password_override" configuration
              setting were turned off.
The noinform, nolog, nomessage, and rule modes require the use of an
administrative password.  For more details, see the "Administrative
command modes" section of the "help admin_commands" document.
