Every Majordomo command supports four administrative command modes.
These modes are:
  noinform -  Do not mail a notice to the list owners.
  nolog    -  Do not record this command in the log.
  quiet    -  Do not send a notice if the command is delayed.
  rule     -  Act as if the "access_password_override" configuration
              setting were turned off.
The noinform, nolog, and rule modes require the use of an administrative
password.  For more details, see the "Administrative command modes"
section of the "help admin_commands" document.
