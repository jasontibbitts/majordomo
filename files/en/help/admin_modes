Every Majordomo command supports four administrative command modes.
Their use requires an administrative password.  The modes are:
  noinform -  Do not mail a notice to the list owners.
  nolog    -  Do not record this command in the log.
  quiet    -  Do not send a notice if the command is delayed.
  rule     -  Act as if the "access_password_override" configuration
              setting were turned off.
For more details, see the "Administrative command modes" section of the
"help admin_commands" document.
