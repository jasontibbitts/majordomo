ALBM


A list of aliases that will be made available for this list.  
After this value has been changed, the createlist-regen command 
must be run to recreate the aliases.

  auxiliary   An alias for each auxiliary list in the "sublists" setting.
  moderate    LIST-moderator
  owner       LIST-owner
  request     LIST-request
  resend      LIST
  subscribe   LIST-subscribe
  unsubscribe LIST-unsubscribe

Currently, owner, resend, and request are mandatory.

NOTE:  Do not confuse this command (used by list owners) with the
"alias" command (intended for regular subscribers).

This configuration does not determine the address pointed to by the
aliases, it simply causes the aliases to be generated for your MTA.
Flexibility motivated this configuration setting. For example, if
the owners and moderators are identical, there is no need for an
additional "-moderator" alias.

Some addresses, like -owner and -moderator, can be set in the list
configurations. Only sublists explicitly mentioned in the "sublists"
configuration setting are given aliases (see "help configset sublists").

The -subscribe and -unsubscribe addresses cause commands to be
generated and sent to the server address as if the user had typed
the command instead of just sending mail to the special address.

What happens to email sent to -request depends upon the (GLOBAL)
request_answer setting and  (list-specific) request_response file.  
  request_answer       result
  --------------       -----------------------------------------
  majordomo            message is parsed for commands (default)
  owner                message is forwarded to the list owners
  anything else        the request_response file is sent back.

If the 'auxiliary' flag in the "configset aliases" is used, an alias will
be created for each auxiliary list.  For example, to reach the
"testers" sublist of the mj2-dev list, a message could be sent
to the (fictitious) address mj2-dev-testers@csf.colorado.edu
Without the 'auxiliary' flag, the "post" command is the only way to send
messages to a sublist.
