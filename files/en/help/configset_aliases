Aliases are e-mail addresses to which people send messages.  Each
alias has a special purpose.


The auxiliary alias
-------------------
If the 'auxiliary' flag in the "configset aliases" is used, an alias
will be created for each auxiliary list.  For example, to reach the
"testers" sublist of the mj2-dev list, a message could be sent to the
(fictitious) address mj2-dev-testers@csf.colorado.edu Without the
'auxiliary' flag, the "post" command is the only way to send messages to
a sublist.

Only auxiliary lists explicitly mentioned in the "sublists"
configuration setting are given aliases (see "help configset_sublists"
for more details).  See "help auxiliary_list" for an introduction to
auxiliary lists.


The moderator alias
-------------------
Mail sent to the LIST-moderator address will be delivered to the
moderators of a mailing list.


The owner alias
---------------
Mail sent to the LIST-owner address will be delivered to the 
owners of a mailing list.


The request alias
-----------------
What happens to mail sent to the LIST-request alias depends upon the
GLOBAL request_answer setting and the list-specific request_response
file, as indicated by the following table:  

  request_answer       result
  --------------       -----------------------------------------
  majordomo            message is parsed for commands (default)
  owner                message is forwarded to the list owners
  anything else        the request_response file is sent back.


The resend alias
----------------
This alias is the address of the mailing list itself.  Mail sent
to this address will be delivered to the list's subscribers.


The subscribe and unsubscribe aliases
-------------------------------------
Mail messages sent to the LIST-subscribe, LIST-unsubscribe, and related
aliases are treated specially by Majordomo.  The bodies of the messages
are ignored. Majordomo will attempt to subscribe or unsubscribe the
address that appears in the "From:" header of the message.

The special extensions of the subscribe alias refer to the delivery
class of the new subscriber.  For example, a subscription made through
the LIST-subscribe-nomail address would start in the "nomail" delivery
class.  See "help set" for a detailed description of delivery classes.
