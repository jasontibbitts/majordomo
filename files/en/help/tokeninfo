The tokeninfo command gives information about a Majordomo command
or posted message that is awaiting confirmation.

Some Majordomo commands require confirmation from at least one person
before they take place.  These commands are considered "stalled" until
the person accepts or reject the command.  Whenever a command is
stalled, majordomo creates a token identifier, or "token" for short,
composed of 12 characters.  The token consists of digits and capital
letters separated into three groups of four characters, for example:

  4AD2-07FC-8985

Each token acts as a password that authorizes someone to accept or
reject a command, and should be kept secret.

A stalled command can be confirmed using the accept command, or
discarded using the reject command.  See "help accept" and "help reject"
for more details.

If the command requires the confirmation from the person who made the
request, the token is called a "confirm" token.  If an administrator
must approve the request, the token is called a "consult" token.  There
are several other, specialized token types; see "help showtokens" for
more details.

If the "nosession" command mode is used, the session information will
not be displayed.  The session information gives details about the
origins of a Majordomo command.  This is useful for locating the source
of subscription forgeries and other kinds of abuse.  The session
information usually consists of message headers for commands sent via
e-mail, or the internet address and port number if the command was made
from one of the web interfaces.

If "remind" mode is used, a reminder message will be mailed to the
address of the person who issued the tokeninfo command.  This is useful
when people who moderate a mailing list using a web interface wish
to obtain a copy of a moderated, posted message via e-mail.

Tokens generally have a limited lifetime.  If nobody explicitly approves
a request, after a few days the token will automatically be removed from
majordomo's database, causing the request to be denied.


Special features for posted messages
------------------------------------
Although the tokeninfo command is normally used to display information
about Majordomo commands, it can also be used to change the contents of
posted messages.  If the tokeninfo command is used to display
information about a posted message, the message will be formatted to
make reading easier.  Only the most important message headers, such as
From, To, Date, and Subject, will be displayed.  Also, any message
attachments will be represented by a brief summary of each attachment.
The summary will have a part number, the content type of the attachment,
and the size of the attachment.

For example, consider the following summary of a moderated message:

[1 multipart/mixed]

From: jane@example.com
To: fred@example.com
Subject: Birthday party photo
Date: Sat, 10 Nov 2001 08:47:41 PST

[1.1 text/plain (0.1 kilobytes)]

Fred,

Here is the phonograph you wanted from Laura's birthday party.

Love, Jane

[1.2 image/jpeg (24.2 kilobytes)]

In this example, the message has type "multipart/mixed" and has two body
parts.  Part number 1.1 is a brief plain text message, and part number
1.2 is a JPEG photographic image.  Making use of message part numbers,
a moderator can see individual parts of a message, remove parts, and
adjust the headers of a message, using the following commands.  These 
commands are only applicable to tokens for posted messages; they do not
affect tokens for Majordomo commands.

In the examples that follow, substitute a valid token identifier
wherever you see the word TOKEN.


The tokeninfo-part command
--------------------------
The tokeninfo-part command will display part of a posted message.  In
the example in the previous section, the command

  tokeninfo-part TOKEN 1.2

would display the data from the JPEG image in section 1.2.  Adding an
'h' or 'H' to the part number will cause the headers to be displayed
instead.  For example, the command

  tokeninfo-part TOKEN 1h

will display all of the message headers.

Also, part number '0' can be used to see the entire original message.

This command should be used with caution; if a body part contains a
malicious worm or virus, Majordomo will make no attempt to shield your
computer against its effects when you view it.


The tokeninfo-part-delete command
---------------------------------
The tokeninfo-part-delete command will remove part of a posted message,
with some restrictions.  The top-level part (part 1) cannot be deleted,
because that would leave the message empty.  The headers of a part
cannot be deleted, because that would make the part invalid.

An "X-Content-Discarded" header will be added to the message indicating
that the part was removed.


The tokeninfo-part-edit command
-------------------------------
The tokeninfo-part-edit command will cause a part or its headers to be
presented in a way that allows the part or headers to be edited and
replaced.  For example,

tokeninfo-part-edit TOKEN 1h

would allow you to edit and replace the headers of a message.
Part number 0 (the whole message) cannot be replaced.


The tokeninfo-part-replace command
----------------------------------
The tokeninfo-part-replace command makes use of a "here document" to 
replace the contents of a message part or its headers.  For instance,
in the birthday example earlier in this document, the moderator may
wish to change the word "phonograph" to "photograph" with the following
command:

tokeninfo-part-replace TOKEN 1.1 <<ABC
Fred,

Here is the photograph you wanted from Laura's birthday party.

Love, Jane
