Majordomo has a flexible framework for deciding who is allowed to 
use majordomo's many features.  Some requests, such as using the
"help" command to learn about majordomo, may be permitted to anyone.
Other actions, such as reviewing the registry of all subscribers
at a site, may be denied outright to everyone except the site administrators.
 
Between these two extremes are actions that require the approval of
at least one person before they take place.  Such actions
are considered "stalled" until the person approves the request
or turns it down.  Whenever an action is stalled, majordomo creates
a token, composed of 12 characters, which will uniquely identify
the action.
 
If the request requires the approval of the person who made the
request, the token is called a "confirm" token.  If someone 
else must approve the request, the token is called a "consult"
token. If the action has been delayed (see "help default" and
"help configset access_rules") the token is called a "delayed token"
and some action will be taken when the delay is over UNLESS the
token is explicitly accepted or rejected first.

Anyone who is aware of the existence of a token can use the "tokeninfo"
command to see the request that is stalled. This is a potential security
risk, since a password may have been used with the command, so keep
the tokens securely private! Anyone with the token string can then
use the "accept" or "reject" command to approve or deny the request.
Most of the data that the "tokeninfo" command displays is also available
through the "sessioninfo" command.

If "full" mode is used, and a token refers to a posted message,
the full message will be shown in the results.  Otherwise, 
only the message headers will be shown.

Tokens generally have a limited lifetime.  If nobody explicitly 
approves a request, after a few days the token will automatically
be removed from majordomo's database, causing the request to 
be denied.
