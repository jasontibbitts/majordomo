# signature_separator
# (/^[-_]/)            [regexp] <parser>
# The text parser will stop looking for commands when it sees a line
# matching this pattern.
#
# The standard signature separator is a line consisting only of two
# dashes followed by one space.  However, many users ignore this
# standard and many sites use underscores instead of dashes.  Hence a
# more lenient pattern is generally more useful.
