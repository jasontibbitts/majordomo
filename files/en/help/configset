The configset command will change the value of one configuration setting
for a mailing list.  A valid administrative password is required to
use the configset command (see "help admin_passwords" for more details
about administrative passwords).  In the examples that follow,
substitute the name of your mailing list wherever you see the word
LISTNAME.  

Many configuration settings can have only one value at a time.  To
give a new configuration setting a single value, following the
name of the setting with the equals sign and the new value.  For
example, the following command will change the value of the "moderate"
setting to "yes".

configset LISTNAME moderate = yes

In some cases, it is acceptable to omit the value.  For example,
the following command will turn off the "moderate" setting:

configset LISTNAME moderate =

Other configuration settings require a list or table of values.  In
that case, it is necessary to use a "here document" to specify all
of the values (see "help here_document" for more details).  For example,
the following command will change the value of the "nonmember_flags"
setting to two flags, "ackdeny" and "postblock":

configset LISTNAME nonmember_flags <<ABCD
ackdeny
postblock
ABCD

Not all list-specific settings can be modified by the list owner.  Some
require the password of a domain or site administrator.  By default,
these settings include:

  aliases
  archive_dir
  config_access
  debug
  delivery_rules
  priority

The "config_access" setting can be used to control the level of
authorization needed to see or change a setting.  See 
"help configset_config_access" for details.

Each configuration setting has its own help file.  For example, to
see a description of the "delivery_rules" setting, use the command
"help configset_delivery_rules" or "help delivery_rules".

If "append" mode is used, the value given in the command is added to the
end of the existing value.  If a setting requires a blank line between
values, such as access_rules and delivery_rules, that line is added
automatically.  The "append" command mode does not work for settings
that do not take more than one value.

If "extract" mode is used, the value given in the command is removed
from the existing value.  If the two values are identical, the
setting is changed to its default value.  If the two values are
not identical, but the extracted value occupies a portion of the
lines of the existing value, that portion is removed from the existing
value.  Otherwise, an error occurs if the values are not identical.

If "noforce" mode is used, the configset command will fail if the new
and old values are identical.  This feature is useful for preventing
default values from being overridden by identical new values.

There are six settings for which the GLOBAL settings are combined with
the list's settings.  They include: 

  admin_body
  admin_headers
  noarchive_body
  noarchive_headers
  taboo_body
  taboo_headers

To see a complete list of configuration settings, use the "help topics"
command.
