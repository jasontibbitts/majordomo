listname, required, is an email list at this site (or "GLOBAL")
variable, required, is one "configset" item
value, if specified, replaces the old variable setting (null may be OK)
<<TAG, if specified, provides more than one line for value (here file)

NOTE: The list of possible variables is in "help topics".

Only savvy list administrators will need to know what follows...
and if you just want a brief description of all the configset options
you can send "help configshow-comments ALL" to the server.

Sets the given variable to the given value.  A single value can be
specified directly on the command line after an equals sign, and that
value can sometimes be null by putting nothing after the "=".

Unless the "= value" form of configset is used, one or more separate
lines of data must be supplied as the new variable's value. This is
done using a "here file" as explained in both "help user commands"
and "help admin commands". For example, to store two owners with the
list MYLIST:
  configset MYLIST owners <<ENDOWNERS
joe@nowhere.com
mary@elsewhere.com
ENDOWNERS

Some commands allow patterns or regular expressions as data fields,
and you should review "help patterns" for an explanation of how
Majordomo and Perl interpret these fields.

The value will be syntax-checked against the allowable values for the
given variable. Once it has been set to any value, a variable can only
be unset with the 'configdefault' command. Setting to null is not same
as setting to the default value!

The 'default password' command can make it much easier to submit several
configset commands at once. The 'configshow' and 'configshow-comments'
commands are how you find out the current settings and get hints for
other ways to set variables. The response from configshow is in such a
form (namely configset commands) that it can be fed back to the parser
verbatim. You will need to put a "default password" line before most
configshow outputs before using them as configset commands since they
are altering the list and require the list password. You can review
"help default" and "help passwords" for more details.

Note also that only the variables that can be seen by the current
authorization level can be altered. This means that with no
authentication at all, a small list of variables may be visible
to configshow even though they cannot be modified with configset.

Finally, note that not all per-list variables can be modified by the
list owner. Some require global priviliges.

There no explanation here of WHY a configset might be needed or how
they interact with each other. For that type of information, send
"help admin overview" to $MJ

For syntax or option information for each variable, send
   help configset VARIABLE
or
   help configset VARIABLE_GLOBAL
to $MJ, appending "_GLOBAL" if the variable applies to the
GLOBAL pseudo-list instead of a regular list.

Note that "configset GLOBAL variable" sets values for the entire site,
while "configset listname variable" sets values for a single list. In
some cases, GLOBAL values can be over-ridden by setting the same
variable to a different value for a given list. In other cases, the
GLOBAL pseudo-list has different variables: these cases will be
indicated by "GLOBAL" in the configset help commands. For example:
   help configset access_rules
   help configset access_rules_GLOBAL

The text returned by each request may be different! In some cases,
the configset variable ONLY applies to the GLOBAL list, as with
   help configset addr_xforms_GLOBAL
and there is no help file for addr_xforms on regular lists.

For a complete list of variables that can be altered with the configset,
configedit, configdefault commands (or can be viewed with the configshow
command), send this to the server and search for "configset":
   help topics
If you know of a configset variable that is NOT in that file, or which
is described incompletely or incorrectly, please contact the maintainer
as indicated at the end of this message.

==> see also: configedit    (to set the variable to a non-default value)
==> see also: configshow    (to display the variable's current value)
==> see also: configdefault (to have the variable track the default value)
==> see also: patterns      (for simple and complex regular expressions)
==> see also: topics        (for a complete list of configset variables)

For a list of topics, or this text, send one of the next two lines
   help topics
   help configset
to the server at $MJ
