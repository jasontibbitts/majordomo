listname, required, is an email list at this site (or "GLOBAL")
variable, required, is one "configset" item
value, if specified, replaces the old variable setting (null may be OK)
<<TAG, if specified, provides more than one line for value (here file)

NOTE: The list of possible configset variables is in "help topics".

Only savvy list administrators will need to know what follows...
and if you just want a brief description of all the configset options
you can send "configshow-comments listname ALL" to the server.

Configset sets the given variable to the given value.  A single value can
be specified directly on the command line after an equals sign, and that
value can sometimes be null by putting nothing after the "=". Configedit
runs only from the mj_shell command line, and displays the configshow
output in an editor: your changes will be automatically accepted as
configset commands when you save them and exit the editor. Configdefault
causes a variable to track the software defaults, and is not always the
same as setting the variable to a null value.

Unless the "= value" form of configset is used, one or more separate
lines of data must be supplied as the new variable's value. This is
done using a "here file" as explained in both "help admin commands"
and "help commands". For example, to store two owners with the list
called MYLIST:
configset MYLIST owners <<ENDOWNERS
joe@nowhere.com
mary@elsewhere.com
ENDOWNERS

Some commands allow patterns or regular expressions as data fields,
and you should review "help patterns" for an explanation of how
Majordomo and Perl interpret these fields.

The value will be syntax-checked against the allowable values for the
given variable. Once it has been set to any value, a variable can only
be unset with the 'configdefault' command. Setting to null is not same
as setting to the default value!

The 'default password' command can make it much easier to submit several
configset commands at once. The 'configshow' and 'configshow-comments'
commands are how you find out the current settings and get hints for
other ways to set variables. The response from configshow is in such a
form (namely configset commands) that it can be fed back to the parser
verbatim. You will need to put a "default password" line before most
configshow outputs before using them as configset commands since they
are altering the list and require the list password. You can review
"help default" and "help passwords" for more details.

Note also that only the variables that can be seen by the current
authorization level can be altered. This means that with no
authentication at all, a small list of variables may be visible
to configshow even though they cannot be modified with configset.

Finally, note that not all per-list variables can be modified by the
list owner. Some require global priviliges.

There no explanation here of WHY a configset might be needed or how
they interact with each other. For that type of information, send
"help admin" to $MJ

For syntax or option information for each variable, send
   help configset VARIABLE
to $MJ

Note that "configset GLOBAL variable" sets values for the entire site,
while "configset listname variable" sets values for a single list. In
some cases, GLOBAL values can be over-ridden by setting the same
variable to a different value for a given list. In other cases, the
GLOBAL pseudo-list has different variables: these cases will be
indicated by the help file.

For a complete list of variables that can be altered with the configset
or configedit commands, or reset with the configdefault commands (or can
be viewed with the configshow command), send this to the server:
   help topics

See Also:
   help configedit    (to display/set the variable from a shell prompt)
   help configshow    (to display the variable's current value)
   help configdefault (to have the variable track the default value)
   help patterns      (for simple and complex regular expressions)
   help topics        (for a complete list of configset variables)

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
