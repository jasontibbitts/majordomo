NAME
    mj_trigger - Simple Majordomo event trigger

SYNOPSIS
    mj_trigger [-d domain] [-v debug_level] -t trigger_type

DESCRIPTION
    mj_trigger is a program designed to be put into the Majordomo user''s
    crontab and called periodically to inform Majordomo that it is time to
    execute its periodic functions.

    A sample crontab entry looks like:

      # Expire locks at midnight
      0 0 * * * /path/to/mj_trigger -t lock
      # Run the hourly trigger at the top of each hour
      0 * * * * /path/to/mj_trigger -t hourly

    Several functions are performed by the triggers, and each has a separate
    argument to the `-t' switch:

    bounce
        Expire bounce data, which is controlled by the *bounce_max_age*
        configuration setting.

    checksum
        Expire duplicate message checksums and message-ids, as indicated by
        the *dup_lifetime* configuration setting.

    delay
        Complete delayed requests.

    digest
        Issue digests, as indicated by the *digests* configuration setting.

    inactive
        Remove registered addresses and subscriptions that have been
        inactive for too long. The maximum period of inactivity is
        determined by the *inactive_lifetime* configuration setting.

    log Remove log entries older in days than the *log_lifetime*
        configuration setting.

    post
        Remove old statistics for posted messages. The expiration age is
        determined by the *post_lifetime* configuration setting.

    session
        Remove session data older than the *session_lifetime* setting.

    token
        Send reminders, and expire old requests and temporary passwords (as
        required by the *token_remind*, *token_lifetime*, and
        *latchkey_lifetime* settings).

    vacation
        Restore the delivery mode of subscribers whose vacation periods have
        expired.

    hourly
        The hourly trigger will invoke any or all of the other trigger
        types, excepting the daily trigger, subject to the time constraints
        in the *digests* and *triggers* configuration settings.

    daily
        The daily trigger will invoke all of the other trigger types,
        excepting the hourly trigger and the digest trigger.


    By default, the mj_trigger program performs its functions for all of the
    Majordomo domains at a site. However, it is possible to limit it to one
    particular domain by using the "-d" switch.

    If the mj_trigger program is run from a shell, the debugging output will
    be sent to the screen (stdout). Otherwise, the debugging output will be
    sent to the mj_trigger.debug file in Majordomo's temporary file
    directory. The default debugging level is 0. This number can be
    increased by using the "-v" switch.
