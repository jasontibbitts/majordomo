If you have more than one email account, you may wish to be able to
post from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a
single address. The "alias" command allows this.

The "unalias" command will remove an existing alias.  Send the "unalias"
command from an e-mail address that is registered at this site.   The
given "address" will then be removed from the database and no longer be
considered equivalent to the registered account.

Here documents
--------------
Domain and site managers can remove more than one alias using a "here
document".  For example, to remove the aliases "a@example.com" and
"b@example.com", a domain administrator could use the following command:

unalias <<ABC
a@example.com
b@example.com
ABC

See "help here_document" for more details.
