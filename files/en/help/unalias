If you have more than one email account, you may wish to be able to
post from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a
single address. The 'alias' command allows this.

Send the "unalias" command from an account that is registered with
the server; the given "address" will then be removed from the database
and no longer considered equivalent to the registered account.

   help subscribe (subscribe your primary address before alias)
