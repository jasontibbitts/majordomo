If you have more than one email account, you may wish to be able to
post from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a
single address. The 'alias' command allows this.

Send the "unalias" command from an account that is registered with
the server; the given "address" will then be removed from the database
and no longer considered equivalent to the registered account.

   help alias     (subscribe once, post from several addresses)
   help subscribe (subscribe your primary address before alias)
