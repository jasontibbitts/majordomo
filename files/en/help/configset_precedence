EXAMPLE:
configset listname precedence = bulk


$INCLUDE-config/precedence

The Precedence header is important because it reduces the likelihood
that vacation notices will be sent to your mailing list, which could
potentially cause a mail loop.

A more general way to replace headers in posted messages is to use the
delete_headers configuration setting to remove existing headers, and to
add headers using the message_headers configuration setting.  If you use
those two settings to change the Precedence headers of messages, the
precedence setting should be changed to contain an empty value.
Otherwise, duplicate Precedence headers may appear in the messages.
See "help admin_delivery" for an example of using the delete_headers and
message_headers settings together.
