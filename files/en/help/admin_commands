This is a basic overview of the commands and features available for use by
the list owner.

approve password command
  This runs the given command (and arguments) with the supplied password.
  Essentially any command can be executed with privileges using the approve
    command.

auxsubscribe list sublist address
auxunsubscribe list sublist address (regex, allmatching)
auxwho list sublist
  Adds/removes address to/from the named sublist of the given list, or
    shows the contents of the named sublist..
  See the 'admin sublists' topic for more information on sublists.
  
configdef list variable
  Sets the variable back to the default value.
  Note that this causes the variable to track changes in the default value
    whenever they are made; a variable can be fixed to the current default
    value by setting it to that value.

configedit list variable (comments)
  (Shell only)
  Retrieves the value of the variable and opens an editor on it.  When the
    editor is exited, the variable is set to the new value.
  Multiple variables can be edited by listing them separated by commas, and
    groups can be specified with upper case letters.
  The editor to use is chosen from the EDITOR environment variable.

configset list variable = value
configset list variable
  Sets the given variable to the given value.  A single value can be
    specified directly on the command line after an equals sign, or the
    usual '<< TAG' include until tag or '<@ part' include from part
    syntaxes can be used.  (See the 'parser' help topic for more
    information on this.)
  The value will be syntax-checked against the allowable values for the
    given variable.

configshow list variable (comments)
  Displays the value of the given variable.
  If the 'comments' mode is given, explanatory information about the
    variable will also be emitted.
  The display is in such a form that it can be fed back to the parser
    verbatim.  It is essentially a series of configset commands.
  Note that if the variable is in all caps, it is taken to be the name of a
    group of variables and so all of the variables in the group are
    returned.  To see all variables, retrieve the variable 'ALL'.
  Note also that only the variables that can be seen by the current
    authorization level will be displayed.  This means that with no
    authentication at all, a small list of variables will still be visible
    (though then of course cannot be modified).
  Finally, note that not all per-list variables can be modified by the list
    owner.  Some require global priviliges.

createlist list owner (nocreate, force)
  Creates the internal structures needed to maintain a list with the given
    name.  This will also suggest the necessary MTA configuration if the
    MTA in use is supported.
  This will fail if the list exists unless 'force' is given.
  The 'nocreate' mode will simply suggest MTA configuration and will not
    fail if the list exists.
  Note that Majordomo does not (yet) handle configuring the MTA itself,
    although it generally provides data which can simply be pasted into the
    necessary configuration file.

default variable value
  (email and text parser only)
  Sets a default variable for the parser.
  Variable can be either password or list.
  Setting a default password will implicitly do the equivalent of
    'approve password' on all following commands.
  Setting a default list makes the list an optional argument for all
    commands which take one (excepting the createlist command).  Note that
    this is not without ambiguity, as the parser cannot always tell when
    the default list is implied.  When running at the -request address, the
    parser generally starts with a default list in place.
  If the value is omitted, the default setting is removed.

filesync list
  This updates the filespace information database.
  Since Majordomo needs to know more information about a file than is
    provided by the file system (a description and the required MIME types,
    for instance) it keeps additional data in a simple database.  If files
    are added or removed by means other than Majordomo commands, the
    database must be updated with the new information by way of this
    command.

post list
  Sends a message to the given list.
  Note that the message must be fully formed, with all necessary headers.
    Majordomo will not add omitted headers, nor does it check the validity
    of the message.  All of the normal resend access checks apply.
  This enables a Majordomo list to be run without doing any MTA
    configuration at all.  The list will not, however, be terribly
    functional.  This will probably work for announcement lists, though. 

put list file subject
put=data list file content-type charset content-transfer-encoding subject
  Uploads a file to the given list's filespace.
  The file will be assumed to be text/plain with 8bit encoding.
  If the "data" mode is given, the command expects additional data about
    the file; these should be legal MIME values for those fields.

rekey list
  Regenerates the canonical forms of addresses in all of list's address
    databases.
  A list keeps three forms of a subscriber's address:
    The full form, including comments.  This is what shows in who reports
      (unless the user elects to hide parts of his adores).
    The stripped form (comments removed).  This is what mail is sent to.
    The canonical form.  This is the result after various address
      transformations have occurred.  The transformations are
      owner-specified and can do such things as specify that all hosts
      under a domain are equivalent, that everything in the user portion of
      an address after a plus sign is ignored (so the sendmail mailbox
      specifier works) and that case is unimportant.
  When the set of transformations is changed, the databases need to be
    regenerated with this command so that the canonical forms reflect the
    different transformations.
  Note that if multiple addresses transform to the same thing under the new
    transformation rules, the duplicates may be lost.
  See the 'config addr_xforms' topic for more information on transforms.

who list regexp
  Returns all members of the list whose addresses match the given regular
    expression.  The match is done insensitive to case, and the surrounding
    '/' delimiters are not required.
