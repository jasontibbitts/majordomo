               Summary of Commands for List Administrators

This document briefly describes every command available to
a list administrator, but no explanation of why they are needed.
For a gentler introduction, please see "help admin".
To learn about Majordomo commands from the perspective of an
end user, see "help commands" and "help overview".

To issue a command, send it in the body of an e-mail message to
  $MJ

The examples in this document assume that you know how to use your 
list's administrative password.  Please review "help admin_passwords",
if you have not already done so. 

The syntax of each command is displayed, followed by a brief description.
In the command syntax, any item in square braces [ ] is considered
optional.  Any word in capital letters should be replaced with an 
appropriate value.  For example, LISTNAME should be replaced with the 
name of a mailing list.

accept [TOKEN]
  The accept command is used by list moderators to approve a posted
  message or other request that was being held for approval.
  See "help accept" and "help admin_moderate" for more details.

  mailing list.  A separate copy of the announcement is sent to each
  recipient.
  See "help announce" and "help admin_documents" for more details.

  asks Majordomo to use a particular password, but only for this
  one command.

  setting.  If the value occupies more than one line, a here document
  is necessary (see "help here_document" for more details).

Administrative command modes
----------------------------

  The commands you send to Majordomo often have one or more command 
  "modes" which alters the behavior of the command.  For example, 
  in the command
    lists-short-enhanced 
  the command modes are "short" and "enhanced".

  Majordomo offers four command modes that can be applied to any 
  command, and are only useful to list owners and site administrators.

  noinform - Do not send an informational message to the list owners.
    The "inform" configuration setting determines when a message
    would normally be sent.  See "help configset inform" for more
    details.

  nolog - Do not log the result of this command.
    For each Majordomo request, one line describing the request 
    and its result is normally added to a global log file.  The 
    contents of the log file can be displayed using the "report" command.
    A site or domain password is required to use this mode.

  quiet - Do not send a notice when a delay token is created.
    It is possible for you to delay the completion of a request
    until later;  see the description of the "default delay"
    command in "help default" for details.  When a request is
    delayed, a notice is usually sent to the person whom the 
    request affects.  That person can follow the instructions
    in the notice to keep the request from being fulfilled, or
    to complete the request immediately. 

  rule - Turn off the "access_password_override" setting temporarily.
    Usually, when you use the master password for a mailing list,
    your requests are completed right away.  This mode causes
    the privileges of the master password to be suspended.  The
    access rules and other restrictions are applied as usual.
    See "help configset access_password_override" for a practical
    example.
    
An administrative password is required to use any of these command
modes.  Please see "help admin_passwords" for a detailed description
of the different types of administrative password.
