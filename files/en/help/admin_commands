Section 1 - Introduction to "help admin commands"

Below are the commands a list administrator may need to use, but
there is little or no explanation of WHY they might be needed or
how they interact with each other. For that type of information,
send "help admin" to $MJ

Each command is further explained by 'help COMMAND', but in this
file you will see a VERY brief description of each command. Every
administration-specific command should be mentioned here, with
all options that pertain to administrators. Some commands have
additional options that are more appropriate for subscribers, and
some commands are only useful to subscribers - those commands are
listed in "help commands". For a complete list of help files, send
"help topics".

For a complete list of ALL commands, see "help topics".

Section 2 - Command Syntax

See "help commands" for information on how to format general commands.
See "help configset" and "help configshow" for more information about
the syntax of those commands (both input and output).

Section 3 - Admin Command Syntax & Summary
