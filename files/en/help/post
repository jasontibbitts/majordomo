The "post" command sends a message to "listname". It may require a
list or site password via "approve".

Note that the message must be fully formed, with all necessary headers.
Majordomo will not add omitted headers, nor does it check the validity
of the message. All of the normal resend access checks apply.

This enables a Majordomo list to be run without doing any MTA
configuration at all.  The list will not, however, be terribly
functional.  This will probably work for announcement lists, though.
