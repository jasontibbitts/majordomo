listname, required, is the name of a list at this site

The "post" command sends a message to "listname". It may require a
list or site password via "approve".

Note that the message must be fully formed, with all necessary headers.
Majordomo will not add omitted headers, nor does it check the validity
of the message. All of the normal resend access checks apply.

This enables a Majordomo list to be run without doing any MTA
configuration, such as creating aliases.  The list will not, 
however, be terribly functional.  This will probably work for 
announcement lists, though.

The "post" command could be used on a moderated list, if the 
moderators wish to edit a message before distributing it.
The edited message would still need to be approved with the
"accept" command, and the original post would have to be denied 
with the "reject" command.

The "post-archive" command may be used to store a message in the
mailing list archive, but not distribute it on the mailing list.
If you maintain a WWW archive of your mailing lists, you might
wish to include a message that describes how to subscribe to
the mailing list.  Obviously, you would not want that message to 
be distributed on the list, since the list's participants are
already subscribed to the list.
