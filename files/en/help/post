listname,    required,     is the name of a regular or auxiliary list
subject,     if specified, gives the contents of the subject header.
-addhdr,     if specified, automatically adds mail headers.
-archive,    if specified, archives a message without distributing it

The post command sends a message to a mailing list, or to an auxiliary
list.  A password is normally required to use this command.  Unlike
other commands, using a password with the post command does not
guarantee that the message is distributed to the subscribers immediately.
The message will undergo the same access checks as if it were sent
using e-mail.

If the "addhdr" command mode is used, Majordomo will consider the 
contents you supply to be a plain text message body, and will
automatically add the From, To, Date, Subject, Message-Id, and
Content-type headers.  The message subject is taken from the 
first command line.

The post command enables a Majordomo list to be run without doing
any MTA configuration, such as creating aliases.  The list will not, 
however, be very functional.  This will probably work for announcement 
lists, though.

The post command could be used on a moderated list, if the moderators 
wish to edit a message before distributing it.  The edited message 
would still need to be approved with the "accept" command, and the 
original post would have to be denied with the "reject" command.
A better approach is to add an "Approved" header to the message;
see "help admin_moderate" for more details.

The post-archive command may be used to store a message in the
mailing list archive, but not distribute it to the subscribers.
If you maintain a WWW archive of your mailing lists, you might
wish to archive a message that describes how to subscribe to
the mailing list.  Obviously, you would not want that message to 
be distributed on the list, since the list's participants are
already subscribed to the list.

To send a message to an auxiliary list, the "auxiliary" option must be 
included in the 'aliases' configuration setting, and the auxiliary list 
name must be included in the "sublists" configuration setting.
