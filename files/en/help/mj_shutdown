NAME
    mj_shutdown - Ask a running queue server to exit.

SYNOPSIS
    mj_shutdown

DESCRIPTION
    The mj_shutdown program sends a message to the mj_queueserv program
    which asks the queue server to exit. The mj_queueserv process is not
    killed. Any existing queue runners are allowed to finish (They will
    notice that the queue server has stopped running when they request more
    work.)

    The mj_shutdown program must be run by the majordomo user.

  Options

    The mj_shutdown program supports the following command line option:

    -t *delay*
        Normally, the queue server will be asked to shut down immediately.
        If this option is used, the queue server will wait for *delay*
        seconds before exiting. This option is useful for delaying message
        processing while the software is being upgraded.
