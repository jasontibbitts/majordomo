# allowed_flags
# (ACHPRS)             [string] <flags>
# A string containing the flags that users are allowed to adjust.  You
# need only include the uppercase flags here:
#
#   A - ack
#   C - eliminatecc
#   H - hide
#   P - prefix
#   R - replyto
#   S - selfcopy
#
# If this is completely empty, users cannot adjust any of their flags.
# The list owner can of course do so.

addendum to Majordomo2 "configset allowed_flags" File - updated 15 Feb 99

NOTE: These allow or disallow changes by subscribers themselves on a
per-list per-subscriber basis. See "help set" for more information,
including digest and nomail settings.

These flags correspond to these "set" commands:
          A  - set listname ackall
          C  - set listname eliminatecc
          H  - set listname hideall
          P  - set listname prefix
          R  - set listname replyto
          S  - set listname selfcopy


==> see also: set (for how a user can set these options after subscribing)
==> see also: configset default_flags (sets per-list defaults before subscribing)
