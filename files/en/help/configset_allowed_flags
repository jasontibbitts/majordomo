EXAMPLE:
configset listname allowed_flags = ACHPRS


A string containing the flags that users are allowed to adjust.
Include only the uppercase flag groupings here:
  A - controls set noack, ackall, ackimportant, ackstall, ackdeny, ackpost, ackreject
  C - controls set noeliminatecc, eliminatecc
  H - controls set nohide, hideaddress, hideall
  P - controls set noprefix, prefix
  R - controls set noreplyto, replyto
  S - controls set noselfcopy, selfcopy
  W - controls set norewritefrom, rewritefrom
If this is completely empty, users cannot adjust any of their flags.
The list owner can, of course, change anything using the list password.

NOTE: These allow or disallow changes by subscribers themselves on a
per-list per-subscriber basis. You cannot restrict access to just one
flag setting, as with "set ackpost" without restricting access to all
the flags in that group (like "set noack").
