Normally, subscribers can change their personal settings with the set
command.  In some situations, the list managers might want to keep
certain settings from being changed.  For example, if the managers of an
announcement mailing list do not want replies to be sent to the mailing
list, they could omit the "replyto" flag from the list of allowed flags.

The "postblock" flag should never be included in the list of allowed
flags.  This flag is used for administrative purposes, to keep a
particular subscriber from posting messages to a mailing list without
the approval of the moderators.
