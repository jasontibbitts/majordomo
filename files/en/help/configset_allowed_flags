EXAMPLE:
configset listname allowed_flags = ACHPRS


A string containing the flags that users are allowed to adjust.  You
need only include the uppercase flags here:

  A - ack
  C - eliminatecc
  H - hide
  P - prefix
  R - replyto
  S - selfcopy

If this is completely empty, users cannot adjust any of their flags.
The list owner can of course do so.
NOTE: These allow or disallow changes by subscribers themselves on a
per-list per-subscriber basis. See "help set" for more information,
including digest and nomail settings.

These flags correspond to these "set" commands:
          A  - set listname ackall
          C  - set listname eliminatecc
          H  - set listname hideall
          P  - set listname prefix
          R  - set listname replyto
          S  - set listname selfcopy

   help set        (for how a user can set these options after subscribing)
   help configset default_flags (sets per-list defaults before subscribing)
