# allowed_flags
# (ACHPRS)             [string] <flags>
# A string containing the flags that users are allowed to adjust.  You
# need only include the uppercase flags here:
#
#   A - ack
#   C - eliminatecc
#   H - hide
#   P - prefix
#   R - replyto
#   S - selfcopy
#
# If this is completely empty, users cannot adjust any of their flags.
# The list owner can of course do so.
