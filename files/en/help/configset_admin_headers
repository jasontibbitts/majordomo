If any of the headers matches one of these regexps, then the message
will be bounced (sent to the list owner) for review.

NOTE: For help on admin_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers.

There are other header traps in place: See "help configset block_headers"
for a description of headers which are both added and looked for.
(Specifically, X-Loop has special meaning!)

The admin_body, admin_headers, noarchive_body, noarchive_headers,
taboo_body, and taboo_headers setting have a special characteristic.
When these six settings are applied to a message that has been
posted to a mailing list, the patterns in the GLOBAL settings are also
used.
