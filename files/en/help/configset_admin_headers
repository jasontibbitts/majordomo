If any of the headers matches one of these regexps, then the message
will be bounced for review. Syntax is described in "help configset admin_body".

NOTE: For help on admin_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers.

There are other header traps in place: See "help configset block_headers"
for a description of headers which are both added and looked for.
(Specifically, X-Loop has special meaning!)
