If any of the headers matches one of these regexps, then the message
will be bounced for review.

NOTE: For help on admin_headers, please send "help configset admin_body"
to the server. All syntax and information is identical, but the "nn"
option (and its comma) which restricts matches to the first few lines is
not present for headers.
