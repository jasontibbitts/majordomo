Section 1 - Introduction to "help commands"

Below are the commands a list subscriber may need to use, but
there is little or no explanation of WHY they might be needed or
how they interact with each other. For that type of information,
send "help overview" to $MJ

Each command is further explained by 'help COMMAND', but in this
file you will see a VERY brief description of each command. Every
user-specific command should be mentioned here, with all options
that pertain to list subscribers. Some commands have additional
options that are more appropriate for list administrators, and
some commands are only useful to administrators - those commands
are listed in "help admin commands". For a complete list of help
files, send "help topics". If you know of a command that is NOT
in this file, but should be please contact the maintainer as
indicated at the end of this message.

For a complete list of ALL commands, see "help topics".

Section 2 - Command Syntax

All Majordomo commands should be sent to $MJ
If you have shell access, refer to "help mj_shell" for an
alternative to sending email to the server (this same text
may be available from "man mj_shell" at the unix prompt).

Please refer to "help end" for ways to ignore automatically inserted
signature blocks, and remember that you MUST NOT allow any text to
be inserted at the top of your email message if that's how you send
commands to Majordomo.

At some sites, there is a "listname-request" address which will also
accept commands pertaining to "listname", but this address is not
always present. (If it is present, and if you use it, you don't need
to specify the list name as part of the command itself.) Other special
addresses like "listname-subscribe" can be set up by the list owner
to imply the list name AND the action without putting anything in the
body of your message to the server. These aliases are not always
present, and don't always do the same thing, so they are not documented
here in the help files. (See "help info" and "help intro" for places
where special addresses should be described on a per-list basis.)

An email address can generally be omitted from a command even if one
is required by the description below. If omitted, the address found
in your email header will be used if it can be determined.

Comments can be included as lines before or after commands. Comments
start with the first # on a line, and continue to the end  of the line.
There is no way to "escape" the # character (e.g. to keep it from
causing the rest of the line to be ignored). Within a here document
(described below), the # sign is NOT a comment character.

Many commands have options available to modify their behavior, and
may take arguments to supply additional information:
 - Arguments are generally separated by spaces, but may use the "<<" syntax.
 - Options start with a dash, and follow the command name without a space.
    (you may use an equal instead of a dash - they are exactly equivalent)

If a command is too long to fit on a line, or if your mail tool is
'wrapping' lines without your knowledge, you may get error messages
back from the server. The errors will NOT say that the line was too
long, but they will show that parts of the line were interpreted as
separate (and incomplete) commands. To fix this, you can "escape" the
line breaks: Anywhere a space is allowed, you can insert a backslash
and a hard return to make the server interpret several lines as just
one command. For example:
  subscribe my-very-long-list-name MyFirstNameHere MyLastNameHere <my_email@my_domain>
is too long for many mail tools. To keep the command from being
broken up, you can type this in your message to $MJ 
(making sure the '\' is the very last character on the first line):
  subscribe my-very-long-list-name \ 
  MyFirstNameHere MyLastNameHere <my_email@my_domain>
The server will then re-assemble the two lines into one command.
Other options include getting a better mail tool and turning off
automatic line wrapping, but don't expect the list owner to do
everything for you when there IS a way to do it yourself.

List owners using "put" to store files must keep in mind that the
backslash described above ALWAYS joins two lines as one, even if
it's part of a file being put and not a one-line command.

All of the Majordomo2 commands and options can be entered with only
LOWER CASE LETTERS with underscore also possible. Commands are NOT case
sensitive, and may be typed in upper case, but lower case is recommended.
Some options and/or arguments may be case sensitive.

A basic command might be:
  COMMAND

A command with an option would then be:
   COMMAND-OPT
or if you prefer seeing it this way
   COMMAND=OPT

Commands may also have arguments after a space:
  COMMAND ARG

Commands may have both options and arguments:
  COMMAND-OPT ARG

The general case, then, is a command with several dash-separated
options and several space-separated arguments:
   COMMAND-OPT1-OPT2-OPT3 ARG1 ARG2 ARG3
or the alternative
   COMMAND=OPT1=OPT2=OPT3 ARG1 ARG2 ARG3

If options are allowed, the help file description of the command
will show all options strung together. Keep in mind that some or
all of the options can be dropped.

If arguments are allowed, the help file description of the
command will show REQUIRED arguments with plain names, and
NON-REQUIRED arguments in square brackets. For example
   COMMAND ARG1 [ARG2]
indicates that COMMAND must have one argument, and may have two.
Read the description carefully to find out what each arg does.

If that's not enough complexity, some arguments require several
lines of input, not just a word or two. In these cases a syntax
is used that Unix people will recognize:
   COMMAND-OPT <<TAG
DATA1
DATA2 DATA3
TAG

This is sometimes called a "here file" because all argument lines
after "<<TAG" and before the matching "TAG" (shown above as "DATA1"
and "DATA2" are stored in the command as if they had been read from
a file. You can use your own string for "TAG", with a few restrictions:
  - the string must be letters only, no numbers or punctuation or spaces
  - the string must be upper case only, no lower case letters
  - the end "TAG" must be on a line by itself (no indents or comments)
It is wise to use different tags for different commands, so they don't
accidentally mismatch due to typing errors.

The "#" character is NOT a comment character between the tags! A blank
line is allowed only as the last line in the here document.  Within a here
document for a string_array, the '-' sign takes on a special significance.
   To embed a blank line in the here document, put a '-' as the first
       and ONLY character on the line.
   To preserve whitespace at the beginning of a line, put a - on the
       line before the whitespace to be preserved
   To put a literal '-' at the beginning of a line, double it.

In addition to the '<<' syntax for supplying arguments to a command, there
is the '<@' syntax.  When followed by a number, this references the
numbered attachment.  (Number 1 being the attachment following the part
containing the commands.)  From the shell interface, this references the
numbered '-f' argument.  (Read the mj_shell manual page for more
information, or send "help mj_shell" to the server.  Note that the shell
interface is only available to users local to the machine running Majordomo.)
This enables the upload of binary files and the like by attaching them to
the command message and doing something like the following:
  approve password put-data mylist image/jpeg none base64 A Picture <@ 1

See "help configset" and "help configshow" for more information about
the syntax of those commands (both input and output).

Section 3 - User Command Syntax & Summary

Each user command is described very briefly here. For other commands,
send "help admin commands" to the server. For more detail on a given
command, send "help COMMAND" to the server. For ideas on which command
to use, send "help overview" to the server.

For basic help, just send "help" to the server at $MJ
For a complete list of help files, send "help topics".
