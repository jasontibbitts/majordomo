This is a basic overview of the supported Majordomo commands.

The modes a command accepts (if any) are listed in parentheses after the
command.  Modes are generally specified by placing them after the command
with an equals sign, as follows:

  subscribe=nowelcome mylist

An address can generally be omitted from the command.  If omitted, your
address will be used if it can be determined.  Note that the address is not
optional for the alias and unalias commands.

For messages sent to the -request address, the list can also be omitted
from the commands.  The list cannot be omitted from commands sent to the
majordomo address.

  The stalled command will be executed and the results returned in the

  If the token is omitted, the Subject: header will be searched for one.
