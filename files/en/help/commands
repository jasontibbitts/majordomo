The "help" command returns a help file from the server, if help is
available for the requested topic. If the requested topic is not
available, an error file is returned.

To get a list of all possible topics, send the message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ and read carefully.

To get basic help, send the message
   help

All commands have help files, but you will probably want to start with
   help user overview
or
   help admin overview
to get an idea of which commands you want to use.

For a list of topics, or this text, send one of the next two lines
   help topics
   help commands
to the server at $MJ
