                      Summary of Commands for Subscribers

This document briefly describes every command available to list
subscribers.  For a gentler introduction, please see "help overview".
To learn about Majordomo commands from the perspective of a list
administrator, see "help admin" and "help admin_commands".

To issue a command, send it in the body of an e-mail message to
  $MJ

The syntax of each command is displayed, followed by a brief description.
In the command syntax, any item in square braces [ ] is considered
optional.  Any word in capital letters should be replaced with an
appropriate value.  For example, LISTNAME should be replaced with the
name of a mailing list.

  request that is being held for approval.  Confirmation is often 
  required when you subscribe to a mailing list, to verify your identity.

  The alias command gives a new e-mail address the same privileges as 
  your original e-mail address.  Your original address must already
