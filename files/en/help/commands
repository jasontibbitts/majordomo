Majordomo2 Subscriber Commands
==============================

This is a basic overview of the supported Majordomo commands for use by
subscribers.  For a list of administrative commands and additional modes,
see the 'admin commands' help topic.

Many commands also have options available to modify their behavior.
Options will appear next to the command names in (parentheses).  Commands
with options should be sent in the format:

        command-option list argument

Multiple options may be strung together like so:

        command-option1-option2-option3 list argument

An address can generally be omitted from the command.  If omitted, your
address will be used if it can be determined.  Note that the address is not
optional for the alias and unalias commands.

Commands may be sent either to the majordomo server's address, or to the
list's -request address (i.e., scooters-request).  For messages sent to the
-request address, the list name can be omitted from the commands.  The list
cannot be omitted from commands sent to the majordomo address.

Examples of the commands that follow will assume an imaginary list named
'scooters'.


accept [token]
--------------
  Some commands will require your confirmation before their actions will be
  taken; this can help protect you from mischief by preventing others from
  submitting commands in your name.  In such a case, a 'token' will be mailed
  to you for approval.

  The 'accept' command tells Majordomo to accept a confirmation or
  consultation token, thus approving the requested action.  The stalled
  command will be executed and the results returned in the response message.

  If the token is omitted from the command, the Subject: header will be
  searched for one; accepting a token therefore usually requires only that
  you hit "reply" on your mailer and type the word "accept".

    See Also:  reject


alias address
------------------
  If you have more than one email address, you may wish to be able to post
  from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a single
  address.  The 'alias' command allows this.

  Send this command from an address that is subscribed to the list; the given
  address will then be considered equivalent to the address from which you
  sent the command.

    Example:  Thad has two addresses, thad@foo.com and tsmith@bar.com.  He
              wants to be able to post from either address, but only wants
              to receive mail at thad@foo.com.  He subscribes to the list
              as thad@foo.com and, from that address, sends the command:

                alias tsmith@bar.com


faq list
--------
  This returns a Frequently Asked Questions document for the current list,
  if one is available


get list file address (-immediate)
-------------
  This retrieves the given file from the list's file storage.  The file
  will be mailed to the supplied address unless the -immediate option is
  used, in which case the file will be returned directly.


help topic subtopic ...
-----------------------
  This retrieves the given help topic.


index list path (-recursive, -long)
---------------
  This retrieves an index of available files.


info list
---------
  This retrieves the given list's informational document, if one is available.


intro list
----------
  This retrieves the given list's introductory document, if one is available.
  Note that this is not (currently) the same as the welcome document that is
  sent to new subscribers.


lists (-enhanced, -short, -tiny)
-----
  This retrieves a list of lists on this server which are available to you.

  The enhanced mode includes long descriptions and additional list
  information, including an indication of whether you are subscribed to each
  list.  The short mode uses only short descriptions.  The tiny mode includes
  only the list names and nothing else.


register address (-nowelcome)
----------------
  This adds an address to the registration database without adding it to
  any lists.

    Example:  register nobody@example.com

    See Also:  unregister


reject [token]
--------------
  This rejects a token, preventing the requested action from being taken.  If
  no 'accept' command is received, the token will eventually be rejected by
  default, but issuing a 'reject' command will immediately delete the token
  and requested action from the server's database.

    See Also:  accept


set list flag address
---------------------
  This sets various subscription parameters.  More documentation to come.


show address
-----------------
  This displays various information about the address:

    - Whether or not the given address is legal
    - The mailbox and comment, extracted from the address
    - What the address transforms to, under the various address
      equivalencies
    - Any aliases attached to the address
    - Any lists the address is subscribed to
    - The time the address was registered
    - The time the registration data was last updated
    - For each list the address is subscribed to:
      - What address is receiving the list mail
      - The time that the address was subscribed to the list
      - The subscription class
      - The subscriber flags
      - The time the record was last updated

    Example:  show joe@foo.com


subscribe list address (-nowelcome)
----------------------
  This adds the address to the given list and to the registration database
  if not already registered.  The 'nowelcome' option prevents the server
  from sending the welcome message that is usually mailed to new
  subscribers.

    Examples:  subscribe scooters
               subscribe-nowelcome scooters joe@foo.com


unalias list address
--------------------
  This removes the given address as an alias for the current address.

    Example:  unalias scooters tsmith@bar.com

    See Also:  alias


unregister address
------------------
  This removes the given address from the registration database and from
  every list that it might be subscribed to.

    Example:  unregister someone@example.com

    See Also:  register, unsubscribe


unsubscribe list address
------------------------
  Removes an address or addresses from the given list.  Even after the
  address has been removed from all lists, it will still exist in the
  registration database.  This allows a user to leave one list and join
  another without obtaining a new personal password.

    Example:  unsubscribe scooters buster@foo.com

    See Also:  subscribe, unregister


which string (-regexp)
------------
  This shows which lists contain addresses which contain the given string.
  The regex option causes the string to be used as a Perl regular expression.

    Examples:  which buster@foo.com
               which-regexp buster\@

    See also:  'regexp' help topic


who list [regexp]
-----------------
  Returns all members of the list.  If a regular expression is given as an
  argument, only matches will be returned.

    Examples:  who scooters
               who scooters \@foo\.com
