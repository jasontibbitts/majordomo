                           Majordomo error files

In an effort to support error messages that are easy to understand and localize,
the error messages are gradually being moved out of the source code and into
separate files.  Each error file is a template file that supports variable 
substitution.  The files are site-specific, but can be retrieved and customized 
on a per-domain basis using the get command.  For example, to customize the 
password_length file, use this command:
  get-edit GLOBAL /error/password_length

Error files are never returned directly.  Instead, their text is incorporated
into the appropriate format file for the command that generated the error
(see "help format_files" for further details).

The variable substitutions supported by each file are listed in parentheses.

invalid_command
---------------
This error message is displayed if a command is requested that Majordomo

------------

Majordomo does not support for a particular command.

and "help configset_password_min_length" for more details).

unknown_setting
------------
This error message is displayed if the configdef or configset command is 
used to change a configuration setting which is not supported by
Majordomo for the list in question.  This may be due to a spelling
error, or due to the fact that some settings are supported only
for the GLOBAL pseudo-list or only for ordinary mailing lists.

(standard plus SETTING)

------------
This error message is displayed if the password command is used to change
the password for an e-mail address that is not yet registered at this
