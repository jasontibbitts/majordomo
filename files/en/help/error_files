                           Majordomo error files

In an effort to support error messages that are easy to understand and localize,
the error messages are gradually being moved out of the source code and into
separate files.  Each error file is a template file that supports variable 
substitution.  The files are site-specific, but can be retrieved and customized 
on a per-domain basis using the get command.  For example, to customize the 
password_length file, use this command:
  get-edit GLOBAL /error/password_length

Error files are never returned directly.  Instead, their text is incorporated
into the appropriate format file for the command that generated the error
(see "help format_files" for further details).

The variable substitutions supported by each file are listed in parentheses.
