EXAMPLE:
configset listname subscribe_policy = closed

WARNING: If you choose set_policy 'open', you allow anyone to forge
         a return address and shut off another subscribers email with
         'set list nomail'. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use
         open+confirm instead.

One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
'+confirm'.  Open allows people to change their list settings,
but attempts to subscribe addresses diferent than where the request is
coming from will require approval.  Auto allows anybody to change
anyone's settings to the list without maintainer approval.  Closed 
requires maintainer approval for all set requests to the list.  Adding
'+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send a reply
back to the subscriber which includes a token.  The subscriber 
must then reply with 'accept' for the command to succeed.

This functionality of subscribe_policy is completely encapsulated within
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists for backwards compatibility
and because it's simpler to use.

Using "closed" allows the list owner to set up list defaults which
are permanent unless the owner changes a subscription with the
list password. This can be useful for "probation" periods, etc.
