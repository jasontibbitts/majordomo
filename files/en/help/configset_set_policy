EXAMPLE:
configset listname set_policy = closed

WARNING: If you choose set_policy 'open', you allow anyone to forge
         a return address and shut off another subscribers email with
         'set list nomail'. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use
         open+confirm instead.

$INCLUDE-config/set_policy

This setting determines who can use the set command to change their 
personal settings on a mailing list.  It has no effect upon auxiliary 
lists.

Using "closed" allows the list owner to set up list defaults which
cannot be changed by the subscribers without the administrators'
approval.  This can be useful for "probation" periods, etc.

An administrative password can be used to issue the set command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the set command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.

For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, this setting determines who can use
the "set ALL" command to change the settings for all of their
subscriptions at once.
