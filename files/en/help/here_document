                              Here Documents
            writing commands that require more than one line

Many Majordomo commands can be written on a single line, for example:
   help admin_commands

Other commands can sometimes require information that spans several
or dozens of lines.  For example, the newinfo command is used
to store a welcome message that is seen by new subscribers:

newinfo cabbage <<ABC123
Welcome to the cabbage mailing list.

The cabbage family has many members, including
collard greens, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower.
ABC123

In this case, the "here document" is the text of the welcome message that
appears between the first command line and the final "ABC123".  The
two "ABC123" markers are called "tags."  The two tags must be identical.  
The tags must conform to the following rules:

  * Tags always begin with three capital letters.

  * Following the first three letters can be any number of
    capital letters or digits.

  * The first tag must be preceded by (only) two less-than symbols,
    '<<'.  The less-than symbols must be separated from the preceding
    part of the command by one or more spaces or tabs.

  * The second tag must be on a line by itself, without leading
    or trailing spaces or tabs.

Usually, the contents of a here document are handled just as you
type them, but there are some exceptions:

  * In the message_footer and message_fronter configuration settings, 
    lines beginning with hyphens are treated specially.  Please see
    "help configset_message_footer" and "help configset_fronter"
    for more information.

  * Any line in a here document that ends with a single backslash '\'
    will be catenated with the next line.  This can have unusual effects
    unless some effort is made to double the backslashes, '\\', in
    which case the extra backslash is removed, and the lines are not
    catenated.

The contents of the here document will vary from command to command.
For instance, a list administrator using the subscribe command can
place a list of addresses in a here document, to subscribe more than
one person at a time:

subscribe-noinform cabbage <<BIG
Jane <sister@example.com>
Joe <brother@example.com>
BIG

Here is a summary of what here documents contain in different 
Majordomo commands.

  * accept, reject          a list of token identifiers.
  * configdef, configshow   a list of settings or setting categories.
  * configset               the new value of a configuration setting.
  * createlist              e-mail addresses of the list owners.
  * post                    the contents of a mail message.
  * newfaq, newinfo         the contents of a new file.
  * newintro, put           the contents of a new file.
  * subscribe, unsubscribe  e-mail addresses of subscribers.
  * set, show               e-mail addresses of subscribers.
  * register, unregister    e-mail addresses of subscribers.

Here documents are supported for commands sent in e-mail messages,
and also by the mj_shell command-line program.
