EXAMPLE:
configset listname subject_re_strip = yes

In conjunction with subject_re_pattern, to remove a number of accumulated
reply indicators.

Some mailers will use strings other than "Re:" in replies, such as "SV:",
"AW:", "Re^2:", etc. as reply indicators.  When several mailers each insist
on prepending their own reply indicators, messages can accumulate an
annoying stack of them.  When subject_re_strip is set, any reply indicators
at the beginning of the sbject header which are matched by
subject_re_pattern will be deleted and replaced with the string "Re:".
