EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL farewell = 1

INCLUDE-config/farewell

In both cases, the farewell_files configuration setting determines which
documents are displayed in the farewell message.

It is possible to override the value of this setting from the command
line.  If this setting is turned off, the "unsubscribe-farewell" command
will cause the farewell message to be sent.
If this setting is turned on, the "unsubscribe-nofarewell" command
will prevent the farewell message from being sent.
