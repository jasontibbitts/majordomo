EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL farewell = 1

INCLUDE-config/farewell

In both cases, the farewell_files configuration setting determines which
documents are displayed in the farewell message.

It is possible to override the value of this setting from the command
line.  If this setting is turned off, the "unsubscribe-farewell" or
"unregister-farewell" command will cause the farewell message to be
sent.  If this setting is turned on, the "unsubscribe-nofarewell" or
"unregister-nofarewell" command will prevent the farewell message from
being sent.
