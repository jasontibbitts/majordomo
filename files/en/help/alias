address, required, is the alternate address you want to post from

If you have more than one email account, you may wish to be able to
post from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a
single address. The 'alias' command allows this. Do not confuse this
command (intended for regular subscribers) with "configset aliases"
(used by list owners).

To post from several accounts, first subscribe to any list with the
address which appears in the mail headers where you want to receive
posts. Then send this one-line msg to $MJ:
       alias YourAlternateEmailAddress
where YourAlternateEmailAddress is actually the address which will
appear in the header of mail from your other account.

Be sure to send that message from your main email address, not the
one you are trying to alias. If "YourAlternateEmailAddress" is already
subscribed to a list on the same server, this command will fail. You
can use the "unregister" command above to remove it, then send the
"alias" command again.

On the other hand, if you for some reason have managed to subscribe
an address at which you can receive mail but can no longer send mail,
you can use the "default user" command to override the return address
in the header of your email to the server. This effectively switches
identities when sending from another account (and establishes an
alias that makes your old account equivalent to your new account):
  default user my_new_address@mydomain.com
  alias my_old_address@anotherdomain.com
This will require confirmation tokens to be returned after they are
sent to both accounts, but it doesn't matter which account is used
to return them.

NOTE: The address GIVEN on the alias command will be considered
equivalent to the address from which you SENT the command when
checking who can post to a list. Note that this applies to ALL lists
at the site, so you only have to alias once per alternate email
address, not once per list.

There is, as of 2/99, no formal way to review the register or alias
databases. Please contact the maintainer shown at the bottom of this
file for a Perl script that assumes shell access.

See Also:
   help configset access_rules_variables (set/test for this command)
   help configset aliases (MTA configuration, used by list owners)
   help register  (must occur before alias will work)
   help subscribe (does an automatic registration)
   help unalias   (to cancel an alias command)
