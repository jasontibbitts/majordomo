address, required, is the alternate address you want to post from
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

If you have more than one email account, you may wish to be able to
post from more than one of them, while receiving list mail at only a
single address. The 'alias' command allows this.

To post from several accounts, first subscribe to any list with the
address which appears in the mail headers where you want to receive
posts. Then send this one-line msg to $MJ:
       alias YourAlternateEmailAddress
where YourAlternateEmailAddress is actually the address which will
appear in the header of mail from your other account.

Be sure to send that message from your main email address, not the
one you are trying to alias. If "YourAlternateEmailAddress" is already
subscribed to a list on the same server, this command will fail. You
can use the "unregister" command above to remove it, then send the
"alias" command again.

NOTE: The address GIVEN on the alias command will be considered
equivalent to the address from which you SENT the command when
checking who can post to a list. Note that this applies to ALL lists
at the site, so you only have to alias once per alternate email
address, not once per list.

There is, as of 2/99, no formal way to review the register or alias
databases. Please contact the maintainer shown at the bottom of this
file for a Perl script that assumes shell access.

See Also:
   help register  (must occur before alias will work)
   help subscribe (does an automatic registration)
   help unalias   (to cancel an alias command)

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
