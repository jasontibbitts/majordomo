EXAMPLE:
configset listname max_header_line_length = 448


Sets the maximum length of a single header in an unapproved message
in number of characters. Set to zero to disable length checks on
individual header lines, use configset max_total_header_length to
check all header lines at once. Actual longest header size and a
boolean for exceeding this limit can be tested in access_rules.

This command can be used to prevent excessive CC'ing or to cut down
on some types of spam.
