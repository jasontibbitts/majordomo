Setting this value to zero will disable header length checks on
individual headers.  The "max_total_header_length" setting can be used
to check the size for all headers combined. 

The length of the longest header in a message is stored in the
"max_header_length" access variable.  If the limit is exceeded, the
"max_header_length_exceeded" access variable will be set to 1.  See
"help configset_access_rules" and "help access_variables" for more
information on access variables. 

Placing a limit on the individual header line length will usually catch
two kinds of message:

  * Messages that have been cross-posted and contain many addresses in
  the "To" or "Cc" headers.

  * Messages that are part of a lengthy conversation and contain many
  message IDs in the "References" header.
