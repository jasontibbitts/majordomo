EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL return_subject = no


$INCLUDE-config/return_subject

For example, if the original message has the following subject header:
  Subject: Hello Mojo
and the return_subject setting is turned on, the subject of the reply
will be:
  Subject: Majordomo results: Hello Mojo
If the return_subject setting is turned off, the subject of the reply
will be:
  Subject: Majordomo results

Only the first 40 characters of the original subject header will be
used in the reply if this setting is turned on.
