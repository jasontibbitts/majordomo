Specifies who will receive error messages for the named list, or for
the GLOBAL pseudo-list.  Majordomo will internally forward mail
received at the -owner address to all of these addresses if the
mail is identified as a bounce message. If this variable is unset,
or specified without data, bounces will be sent to the list owners.
