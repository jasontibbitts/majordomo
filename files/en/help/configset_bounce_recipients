$INCLUDE-config/bounce_recipients

Many domains have an e-mail address (e.g., "nobody") for which incoming
mail is automatically discarded.  If you wish to stop receiving bounce
notices, change the bounce_recipients setting to direct bounces to that
address.

Bounce messages are recorded in full in the session log.  To see a list
of recent bounces and their session numbers, use the report-full
command.  Then, use the sessioninfo command to retrieve individual bounce
messages.
