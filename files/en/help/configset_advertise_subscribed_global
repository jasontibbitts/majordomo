(extracted on 7 Mar 1999 from configshow-comments, default value is below)

# advertise_subscribed
# (yes)                [bool] <majordomo,access,advertise,lists>
# If this is on, users that are subscribed to a list will always be
# shown that list, regardless of any advertise restriction; the list's
# advertise restrictions will not even be consulted.  This can result in
# a performance increase.
#
# If this is off, the list's advertise restrictions will be consulted
# normally.  This will still result in the same behavior unless an
# access_rules entry is used to override the normal processing of
# advertise/noadvertise, but list owners will then have the choice.
