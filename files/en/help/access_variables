                      Access Commands and Variables

This document contains all commands and variables which can be controlled
through the access_rules configuration setting, and also shows which 
variables can be tested, set, and unset while handling those requests. 
Please refer to "help configset_access_rules" for a detailed explanation.

This file does not contain any file substitution variables, which cause 
new values to be substituted into reply messages.  To learn more about
substitution variables, see "help variables".

There are four sections in this document:
  * The commands for which access rules can be used
  * The variables available for each command
  * An explanation of each access variable
  * An explanation of each notify directive variable

  who               access


Every command has a default level of access that determines who
can use the command.

access
  The access is determined by a configuration setting.  For example,
  the "which" command is controlled by the "which_access" setting.

allow
  Anyone can use the command.

confirm
  The person affected by the request must approve.

confirm2
  Both the person affected by the request and the person making
  the request must approve.

consult
  The moderators must approve.

deny
  Only the list owners can use the command.

mismatch
  The command will succeed unless one person attempts to affect
  someone else with the command.

policy
  The access is determined by a configuration setting.  For example, the 
  "subscribe" command is controlled by the "subscribe_policy" setting.

special
  The access is determined by the access_rules settings in concert
  with other configuration settings.

Each variable has a type that limits what values the variable can take.

boolean
  1 or 0, meaning true or false, respectively.

number
  A whole number.

string
  A string of characters.

timespan
  An abbreviation that indicates a length of time, such as "3d" for three
  days.  See "help times" for more details.


An explanation of each access variable
-------------------------------

addr 
  This variable contains the user's address, stripped of comments.
  (such as "jane@example.org')

admin
  This variable is set if any "admin" variable is set.  It is possible
  for the admin configuration settings to create access variables.  
  See "help configset_admin_body" and "help configset_admin_headers" for
  more details.

any
  This variable is set if any of the dup, taboo, admin, mime, bad_approval,
  or invalid_from variables is set.  It provides a convenient way to test 
  whether or not a posted message violated any of the standard message checks.

bad_approval
  This variable is set if an "Approved" line with an invalid password is
  present in a posted message.  See "help admin_moderate" for more details on
  Approved lines.

blind_copy
  This variable is set if a posted message does not contain the address
  of the mailing list in its To or Cc headers.

body_length
  This variable contains the total number of characters in the body parts 
  of a posted message.

body_length_exceeded
  This variable is set if the size of a posted message exceeds the 
  value in the maxlength configuration setting.

chain
  "Chaining" occurs when a series of people must approve a request.  For 
  example, if Jane tries to subscribe Ruth to a mailing list, the approval 
  of both Ruth and the moderators of the mailing list would be required 
  (this is called "confirm_consult" in the access rules).  Normally, a 
  notice would sent to Ruth, and if Ruth approves, a notice would be sent 
  to the moderators.  Unsetting the chain variable would cause notices 
  to be sent to the moderators and to Ruth simultaneously.

days_since_subscribe
  This variable contains the number of days since the e-mail address (from
  which a message was posted) was subscribed to a mailing list.  If the
  message was not posted by a subscriber, this variable is set to -1.

delay
  This variable holds the length of time a request will be delayed.
  See "help delay" for more details. 

dup
  This variable is set if any of the dup_checksum, dup_partial_checksum, or 
  dup_msg_id variables is set.

dup_checksum
  This variable is set if the first body part of a posted message has been 
  sent to the same mailing list recently.

dup_msg_id
  This variable is set if the Message-ID header of a posted message has been
  sent to the same mailing list recently.

dup_partial_checksum
  This variable is set if the first ten lines of a posted message have been
  sent to the same mailing list recently.

expire
  When a request requires someone's approval, there is a time limit for
  approval that is determined by the token_lifetime configuration setting.
  This variable is a time span that can be used to override the token_lifetime
  setting.  See "help times" for more details on time spans.

fulladdr
  This variable contains the address of the person affected by a request, 
  including any comments (such as "Jane Smith <jane@example.org>").

hide_post
  This variable is set if the 'hidepost' flag is set for the address from
  which a message was posted.  See "help configset_nonmember_flags" and
  "help set" for more details.

host
  This variable contains the domain name in the address of the person
  affected by a request (such as "example.org").

invalid_from
  This variable is set if the e-mail address in the From header of a posted
  message is not a valid address.

interface
  This variable contains the name of the interface used to make a
  request, such as 'email', 'shell', or 'wwwadm'.

limit
  This variable is set if either of the limit_hard or limit_soft variables
  is set.

limit_hard
  This variable is set if a posted message exceeded a hard limit, as
  determined by the post_limits configuration setting.

limit_soft
  This variable is set if a posted message exceeded a soft limit, as
  determined by the post_limits configuration setting.

lines
  This variable contains the total number of lines in a posted message.

master_password
  If an administrative password was used to issue a command, this variable
  will contain the level of the password (see "help admin_passwords" for
  more details).  Normally, an administrative password will cause a request
  to be completed immediately; however, the access_password_override
  configuration setting can be used to change this behavior (see
  "help configset_access_password_override" for more details).

matches_list
  This variable is set if an attempt is made to subscribe a listname
  to itself, which would create a mail loop.

max_header_length
  This variable contains the number of characters in the longest header
  of a posted message.

max_header_length_exceeded
  This variable  is set if the longest header of a posted message exceeds
  the size limit in the max_header_line_length configuration setting.

mime
  This variable is set if either mime_consult or mime_deny is set.

mime_consult
  This variable is set one or more body parts of a posted message were
  marked for moderation by the attachment_rules configuration setting.

mime_deny
  This variable is set one or more body parts of a posted message were
  marked for rejection by the attachment_rules configuration setting.

mime_header_length
  This variable contains the number of characters in the longest 
  header that describes a body part of a posted message.

mime_header_length_exceeded
  This variable is set if the number of character in the longest
  MIME headere exceeds the value of the max_mime_header_length
  configuration setting

mime_require
  This variable is set one or more body parts of a posted message were
  required to be present by the attachment_rules configuration setting.

mismatch
  This variable is set if the e-mail address of the person making a
  request and the e-mail address of the person affected by a request
  are different.

mode
  This variable contains the command mode.  For example, it contains 
  "enhanced" when the who-enhanced command is used.

noarchive
  This variable is set if any "noarchive" variable is set.  It is
  possible for the noarchive_body or noarchive_headers configuration
  setting to create access variables.  See "help configset_noarchive_body"
  and "help configset_noarchive_headers" for more details.

nonempty_lines
  This variable contains a count of the number of lines in the message
  which are not empty (i.e. which consist of at least one non-whitespace
  character).

password_length
  This variable contains the length in characters of a new personal 
  password which is specified in the password command.  It can be
  used to enforce a minimum length for new passwords.

percent_quoted
  This variable contains the percentage of lines in a posted message
  which are quoted, between 0 and 100.  A "quoted" line is one which
  indicates that a portion of a message was written by someone else.
  Quoted lines frequently begin with a '>'.

posing
  This variable is set if the "default user" command is used to masquerade
  as a different e-mail address.  See "help default" for more details.

post_block
  This variable is set if the 'postblock' flag is set for the address from
  which a message was posted.  See "help configset_nonmember_flags" and
  "help set" for more details.

quoted_lines
  This variable contains the number of lines in a posted message that 
  matched the patterns in the quote_pattern configuration setting.  A
  quote is a marker, such as '>', which is used to indicate that part
  of a posted message was originally written by someone else. See
  "help configset_quote_pattern" for more details.

sublist
  This variable is set to the name of an auxiliary list, if a request
  pertains to an auxiliary list (See "help auxiliary_list" for more
  details).

taboo
  This variable is set if any "taboo" variable is set.  It is possible
  for the taboo configuration settings to create access variables.  
  See "help configset_taboo_body" and "help configset_taboo_headers" for
  more details.

total_header_length
  This variable contains the sum of the lengths of all of the headers
  of a posted message. 

total_header_length_exceeded
  This variable is set if the sum of the header lengths of a posted
  message exceeds the value in the max_total_header_length configuration
  setting.

user_password
  This variable is set if the personal password of the e-mail address
  that was affected by a request is used.


An explanation of each notify directive variable
------------------------------------------------

Notify directives determine who receives a confirmation notice when a 
posted message or request is held for approval.  The default value of 
each variable will depend upon the type of notice (confirm, consult, or 
delay).

approvals
  This variable contains the number of approvals required by person
  or a group of moderators when a request or posted message is moderated.  If
  it is greater than 1, each moderator will receive a separate 
  confirmation notice.  The default value is 1.  A value of 0 would
  make the approval of a particular group or person unnecessary,
  which may be useful in situations when more than one person or
  group receives a confirmation notice.

attach
  When a posted message requires confirmation, the message is usually
  attached to the confirmation notice.  Unsetting this variable will
  avoid the attachment.  The default value is 1 for consult notices,
  and 0 for confirm and delay notices.
  
bounce
  If a notice cannot be delivered to its recipients, this variable
  determines if the delivery failure will cause the original request
  to be discarded.  The default value is 1 for confirm notices, and
  0 for consult and delay notices.

file
  This variable determines which document is sent in the confirmation
  notice.  The default value is 'confirm' for confirm notices, 'consult'
  for consult notices, and 'delay' for delay notices.

fulfill
  This variable determines what happens when a request expires.
  Normally, requests that expire will simply be discarded.  However,
  if the fulfill variable is set, the request will be completed when
  it expires.  The default value is 1 for delay notices and 0 for confirm
  and consult notices.

group
  This variable determines who receives a confirmation notice when a
  request requires approval.  There are four standard values:

  moderators  
    The moderators of the mailing list receive a notice.

  none
    Nobody receives a notice.
   
  requester
    The person who made the request receives a notice.

  victim
    The person affected by a request receives a notice.

  In addition, the group can be the name of any existing auxiliary list
  (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details).  The default value is
  victim for confirm and delay notices, and moderators for consult 
  notices.

pool
  This variable allows only a few moderators to receive a notice when
  a request is moderated.  For example, if there are 5 moderators, and
  the pool variable is set to 2, two of the moderators will be chosen
  randomly to receive a notice.  Normally, the number of moderators is
  determined by the moderator_group configuration setting. The default
  value is -1, meaning that the moderator_group setting determines the
  pool size.  A value of 0 would cause all of the moderators to receive
  a notice.

remind
  This variable allows the time at which a reminder notice is sent to
  be changed.  Reminder notices are usually sent after a number of
  days, as indicated by the token_remind configuration setting.  This
  variable should be set to a time span, such as "12h" for twelve
  hours or "3d" for three days; see "help times" for more details on
  time spans.  The default value is -1, meaning that the token_remind
  configuration setting is used to determine when the reminder is
  sent.
