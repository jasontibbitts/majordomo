The 'accept' command tells Majordomo to allow or approve some requested
action. Note that the token can be returned from the address which made
the request, or from another address! If you did not make the request, be
sure you follow up with whoever did after accepting or rejecting the token.

Some commands will require your confirmation before their actions will be
taken; this can help protect you from mischief by preventing others from
submitting commands in your name.  In such a case, a 'token' will be
mailed to you for approval. (For example, joe@nowhere.com tries to
subscribe mary@elsewhere.com to an email list - perhaps Joe is doing
Mary a favor, or perhaps he's being malicious... either way, Mary gets
a token so she can accept or reject the subscription before it happens.)

A token is also called a magic number, because you are getting an email
message with a long number in the subject line. That number is remembered
by Majordomo. When you send the number back Majordomo knows it has reached
you because the number acts like a one-time-only password.

If the token is omitted from the command, the Subject: header will be
searched for one; accepting a token therefore usually requires only that
you hit "reply" on your mailer and type the word "accept".

Once Majordomo receives your acceptance, the stalled command will be
executed and the results returned in a response message. If you do not
accept or reject the token, Majordomo eventually "times out" based on
site or list settings. Waiting too long is the same as rejecting.
Majordomo will try to remind you that it is about to give up before
timing out. The list owner or site administrator sets the number of
days for token reminders and expirations.

Site administrators should refer to "help configset access_rules" for
ways to change the message which asks for accept/reject tokens.
