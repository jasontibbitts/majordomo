The put command stores a document in the file space of a mailing list.
The document can then be retrieved with the get command, and the name
of the file and its description will appear in the output of the index
command. Normally, an administrative password is required to use the
put command.

The name of the file or directory that is created with the put command
is governed by the conventions described in the "help admin_documents"
document.  To summarize, any file or directory name that does not begin 
with a leading slash, '/', will be created in the public section of the file
space;  any file or directory name that starts with a '/' will be created
in the private section of the file space.

The description, if supplied, should be an unpunctuated string of words 
separated by spaces.   It will appear in the Subject header if the file 
is mailed to someone who uses the get command, or if the file is mailed 
as a result of the "replyfile" or "mailfile" directives of the 
access_rules configuration setting (see "help configset_access_rules" 
for more details).

If the description is enclosed in quotes, the quotes will appear in the 
output of the index command and anywhere else the subject is displayed.

In addition to the description, there are four pieces of information
that are stored about each file.  They are summarized in the following
table:

Data                            Default value
====                            =============
content type                    text/plain
character set                   ISO-8859-1
content transfer encoding       8bit
language                        en

If the default values do not correctly represent the document, they
can be overridden with the "data" command mode.  For example, to
store a WWW page, you could use the following command:

put-data LISTNAME /test.html text/html us-ascii 7bit en Web Page <<LLL
<h2>Hello, World</h2>
LLL

The put-dir command may be used to create a directory (also called a
folder).  The put-dir command does not require any data or contents.
Once a directory is created, files can be stored in that directory.  

Normally, if the parent directory of a new file or directory does not
already exist, the put command will fail.  If the "force" command mode
is used, any missing parent directories will be created automatically.

The put-delete command may be used to remove a file or an empty
directory.  The put-delete command does not require any data or
contents.  If the "force" command mode is also used to remove a
directory, all of its contents will be removed as well.

The contents of any file must be specified using a here document.
For example, the following command creates a document called "test"
in the top-level directory of the file space for the LISTNAME mailing
list:

put LISTNAME /test A test file <<FIN
  This is the first line of the file
 This is the second line!
FIN

See "help here_document" for more details on here documents.  Any lines
in the contents of the file that end in a backslash, '\', will be 
catenated with the following line.

File names and descriptions are case-sensitive.  Be sure to type upper 
and lower case letters exactly as you want them to be shown by the index 
command.  List names are not case-sensitive.

File and directory names are always relative to the top-level directory 
of the file space for a mailing list.  As a result, the file names that 
you use in the put command will always be shorter than the real file
or directory name on the computer that runs the Majordomo server.

Site administrators can store files in the filespace of the DEFAULT list 
as a way of providing files to all lists and all users at once.  This
approach can be used to override the stock files that are supplied by 
Majordomo.  This should be done with caution, because Majordomo does not 
offer a way to delete files that have been created with the put command.  
See "help reply_files" and "help format_files" for a list of some of the 
stock files.

Help files can be replaced by storing them in the "/help" directory of
the GLOBAL pseudo-list.  For example, the following command:

put GLOBAL /help/emergency Crisis line <<LLL
Contact majordomo-owner@example.com
LLL

would create an "emergency" help file that could be retrieved with the
"help emergency" command.
