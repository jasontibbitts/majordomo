The length of time in days that a user's bounce data will be tracked.

The bounce_max_count and bounce_max_age settings are just used for
expiring old bounce data; we don't want to keep too much of it around
and so we delete a bounce datum if it is too old or we have too many
(in which case, the oldest are tossed).

Expiry of bounce data happens daily.  You can see a summary of a user's
bounce data using the show command, and the body of the bounce is stored
in the session file (retrievable with the sessioninfo command and expired
as normal).
