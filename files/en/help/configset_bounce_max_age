$INCLUDE-config/bounce_max_age

The bounce_max_count and bounce_max_age settings are just used for
expiring old bounce data; we don't want to keep too much of it around
and so we delete a bounce datum if it is too old or we have too many
(in which case, the oldest are tossed).

Expiration of bounce data happens daily by default.  The frequency can be
changed by adjusting the "triggers" configuration setting.  

Subscribers and domain administrators can see a summary of a
subscriber's bounce data using the show command.  List administrators
can see a complete list of addresses with bounces using the who-bounce
command.

The error message that contains a complete description of the delivery
failure is stored in a session files.  Session files can be viewed using
the sessioninfo command.  To find the session number for a particular
bounce, use the report-full command.
