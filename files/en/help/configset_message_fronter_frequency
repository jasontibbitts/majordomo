# message_fronter_frequency
# (100)                [integer] <resend>
# Controls how often a message_fronter will be added to outgoing
# messages.  Set this to a number and on average fronters will be added
# to that percentage of messagees.  If this is set to 100 or greater,
# fronters will always be added.  If set to 0 or below, fronters will
# never be added (even if fronters are defined).
#
# Note that this only makes sense if one or more fronters have been set
# in message_fronter.  Note also that this only controls the probability
# that a fronter will be added; the process itself is random.
