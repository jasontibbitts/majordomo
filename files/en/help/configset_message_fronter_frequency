EXAMPLE:
configset listname message_fronter_frequency = 100


Controls how often a message_fronter will be added to outgoing
messages.  Set this to a number and on average fronters will be added
to that percentage of messagees.  If this is set to 100 or greater,
fronters will always be added.  If set to 0 or below, fronters will
never be added (even if fronters are defined).

Note that this only makes sense if one or more fronters have been set
in message_fronter.  Note also that this only controls the probability
that a fronter will be added; the process itself is random.
