used only in "configset access_rules" for the GLOBAL pseudo-list

The "advertise" command is used only in majordomo's access_rules 
configuration setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. There must
be several lines of data after the access command, as described
by "help configset access_rules".

The advertise command is used to determine whether or not the
existence of a mailing list should be made public in the results
of the "lists" command and the "which" command.
 
For example, a list owner who wanted only people with addresses in
the example.net domain to know about the list might use this rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
advertise
deny
!/example.net/
ENDTAG
