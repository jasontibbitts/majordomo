Majordomo saves the complete headers of all e-mail messages containing
commands, along with a summary of the results of the commands.  The
headers of posted messages and messages to the list owners are also
saved in individual session files.  The host name, port, and date are
saved for commands issued using the WWW interfaces.  

Because the session files can occupy significant space on an active
server, old files are removed periodically.  The frequency of removal is
controlled by the "session" trigger in the GLOBAL triggers configuration
setting; by default, this happens daily.

An individual session file can be viewed using the sessioninfo command.

The session number that corresponds to each previously-issued command
can be seen using the report-full command.

The session files are stored in the "sessions" subdirectory of the main
directory of the GLOBAL pseudo-list.
