EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL index_access = list

$INCLUDE-config/index_access

This setting determines who can use the index command to see a 
listing of one or more directories from a list's public file space.

An administrative password can be used to issue the index command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the index command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
