EXAMPLE:
configset listname unsubscribe_policy = open


WARNING: The default unsubscribe_policy (open) allows anyone to forge
         a return address and remove another subscriber from the
         list. The "auto" setting allows the same thing without even
         faking the From field. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use
         open+confirm instead. The default is for compatibility with Mj1.

$INCLUDE-config/unsubscribe_policy

This setting determines who can use the unsubscribe command to remove 
addresses from a mailing list.  It has no effect upon auxiliary lists.

An administrative password can be used to issue the unsubscribe command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the unsubscribe command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.

Regardless of the value of this setting, it is only possible
to unsubscribe multiple addresses at once, using the unsubscribe-pattern
command, with an administrative password.
