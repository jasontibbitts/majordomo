EXAMPLE:
configset listname unsubscribe_policy = open


WARNING: The default unsubscribe_policy (open) allows anyone to forge
         a return address and remove another subscriber from the
         list. The "auto" setting allows the same thing without even
         faking the From field. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use
         open+confirm instead. The default is for compatibility with Mj1.

One of three values: open, closed, auto; plus an optional modifier:
'+confirm'.  Open allows people to unsubscribe themselves from the list,
but attempts to unsubscribe addresses different from where the request is
coming from will require approval.  Auto allows anybody to unsubscribe
anybody to the list without maintainer approval.  Closed requires
maintainer approval for all unsubscribe requests to the list.  Adding
'+confirm', (i.e. 'open+confirm') will cause majordomo to send a reply
back to the subscriber which includes a authentication number which
must be sent back in with another unsubscribe command.

This functionality of unsubscribe_policy is completely encapsulated in
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists for backwards compatibility
and because it's simpler to use.

Regardless of the unsubscribe_policy setting, you cannot use wild
cards (e.g. "unsubscribe-regexp") without the list password.
