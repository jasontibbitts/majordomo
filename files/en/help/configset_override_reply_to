$INCLUDE-config/override_reply_to

The override_reply_to setting only affects messages that are delivered
to subscribers with the "replyto" personal setting turned on.  See
"help set" for more details on personal settings.

To replace the Reply-to header for every recipient of a message, the
delete_headers and message_headers settings should be used instead.
This will violate the intent of the "replyto" personal setting.

The override_reply_to setting has no effect on digests.
