If this setting has a negative value, inactive subscriptions and registrations 
will never be removed.

Registrations are only affected by the inactive_lifetime setting for the
GLOBAL pseudo-list.  

The "inactive" trigger in the triggers configuration setting determines
how often inactive addresses will be removed.

Inactive registrations occur when people use the unsubscribe command to
leave a mailing list, but do not use the unregister command to remove
their registration information.  Inactive subscriptions occur when
people suspend delivery while they are on vacation, then forget to
resume delivery when they return.  Removing inactive addresses makes the
subscription databases smaller, which helps Majordomo to run faster.

When a subscription expires, if the "farewell" setting for the mailing
list in question is turned on, a farewell message will be sent to the
subscriber.  A farewell message will never be sent when a registration
expires.

Some mailing lists are configured to allow only subscribers to post
messages.  Some people who wish to post messages from more than one
address may subscribe all of their addresses, then put all but one of
them into the "nomail" delivery class.  A better approach for people
with more than one address is to use the alias command to tell Majordomo
that two or more addresses belong to the same person.
