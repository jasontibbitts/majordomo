EXAMPLE:

The list's master_password can be used to issue any command that applies 
to the list.  It is a level 2 password (see "help admin_passwords" for 
a description of password levels).  It also allows the review of list 
information, with commands like "who," that may otherwise be disabled.

To change a password you will need to approve the command as follows:

   approve CURRENTPW configset LISTNAME master_password = NEWPW

or as two separate commands:

   default password CURRENTPW
   configset LISTNAME master_password = NEWPW

Replace LISTNAME with the name of your mailing list, NEWPW with the new
master password, and CURRENTPW with the old master password.

The GLOBAL master_password for a domain works on every list in that domain
and for configuring the special GLOBAL pseudo-list. It should be reserved
for use by the domain administrator in most cases. Note that a host computer
can contain several virtual domains, and the GLOBAL password is unique for
each such domain; see "help admin_domain" for more details.

See "help configset_passwords" for other limited or subsidiary passwords
that can be used to delegate list management tasks without releasing the
master password.
