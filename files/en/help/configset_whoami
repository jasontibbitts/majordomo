EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL whoami = majordomo@example.org


$INCLUDE-config/whoami

If this address does not contain a domain, the domain from the GLOBAL
whereami configuration setting will be appended automatically.  For
example, the following two commands are equivalent if the value of the
whereami setting is "example.org":
  configset listname whoami = listname
  configset listname whoami = listname@example.org
  
The value of this setting can be included in various reply files and
configuration settings through the WHOAMI and MJ substitution variables.
See "help variables" for an introduction to substitution variables.


                     Note for Domain Administrators

When a confirmation token for a posted message is accepted, Majordomo
will mail a message containing an "accept" command to the address in the
GLOBAL whoami setting.  For that reason, changing the GLOBAL whoami
setting to an inappropriate address may cause some approved messages not
to be delivered.  The following command:

  showtokens-async ALL

can be used to see if any accepted posts have not been delivered
properly.
