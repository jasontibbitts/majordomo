What address do users send requests to?
These important help files are related:
   help configset whereami
   help configset whoami
   help configset whoami_owner

If you do not specify "whoami_owner", the string "-owner" will
be appended to the value of "whoami" from the appropriate list.


For normal lists:
  The default value of "whoami" is the name of the list itself,
  and things will function just fine if you don't specify "whoami".
  If your list is called "listname@nowhere.org", then you would use
     configset listname whoami = listname
  The domain will be supplied by "whereami" if you don't supply it.

  In spite of the comments produced by configshow, the "whoami"
  address is not the address for requests, it is the address where
  subscribers send posts for distribution.


For the GLOBAL pseudo-list:
  You should set "whoami" to be the address of the server, such
  as "majordomo@nowhere.org". This can be a fully qualified address,
  including the domain, but only if you also specify "whoami_owner".
  Letting "whoami_owner" default after supplying a domain for "whoami"
  will cause commands like "lists" to die horribly due to a malformed
  email address.

  For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, the configshow comments are right.
  This is the address to which people send "subscribe" and other
  such requests.

  WARNING:  If you fail to specify "whoami_owner" after supplying
  a full email address (including domain) for "whoami", commands
  like "lists" to die horribly due to a malformed email address.
