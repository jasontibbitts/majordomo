Iterated command.  Obtain raw or summarized
data for recent log entries for a mailing list.
The data can be constrained by action or by date.

This command
  report LISTNAME ALL,owner 24h
will show the entries for the last day.  Use ALL as the list
name to get entries for all of the lists.

For instance,
  report nectarine ALL 12h
would list all log entries for the nectarine list over the 
last 12 hours (excepting owner and trigger actions).
  report-summary nectarine ALL 12h
would give a summary of actions that appears like this:

Activity for nectarine from 2000-08-03 02:53 to 2000-08-03 14:53
