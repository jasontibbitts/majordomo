listname, required, is an email list at this site
-full,    if specified, displays the session number and interface
-inform,  if specified, uses the set of actions in the "inform" setting
-summary, if specified, gives a table summarizing the number of events
action,   if specified, is a comma separated list of things to report
date,     if specified, determines the period of time to report on

EXAMPLE:
  report-summary nectarine 12h ALL
might display the following report:

Activity for nectarine from 2000-08-03 02:53 to 2000-08-03 14:53
     Command:   Total  Succeed Stall Fail  Time
    announce:    7      6       0     1    1.375
         faq:    1      1       0     0    0.849
      report:    2      1       0     1    5.439 
         who:    1      1       0     0    2.247

The "report" command displays raw or summarized data for recent log
entries for a mailing list, and can be constrained by action or date.
The "summary" command mode results in a table summarizing how many of
each kind of event occurred.  Otherwise, each event is reported.

The specified "listname" can be any regular list, or "ALL" to report on
all mailing lists, or one of the pseudo-lists "DEFAULT" or "GLOBAL".
Reporting on "GLOBAL" will inform you about commands such as accept,
reject, lists, which, and help. Reporting on "DEFAULT" shows commands
that act on the system defaults, like "configset DEFAULT". Reporting on
a regular list will inform you about things like subscription requests
and attempts to post.

If you specify a "date" field, the report will be restricted to a
period of time. Without "date", all events since the software was
installed will be reported. Dates can be specified in several formats:
 1. for the last N hours, days, weeks, months, or years, use the
    format shown in the "Time Period" section of "help times".
    For example, "3h" reports on events during the last 3 hours.
 2. for a given year, month, week, or day, use the format shown in
    the "Time Stamp" section of "help times". For example, "200007"
    reports on events during the month of July 2000.

The "inform" command mode will cause the actions for which "report" is
specified in the inform configuration setting to be displayed.  Any
actions specified in the report command itself will have no influence on
the output.

If you specify majordomo commands in a comma-separated list of actions,
only those types of events will be reported. If you specify no actions,
or if you use "ALL" as the action, all events will be reported.  See
"help topics" for a list of commands that can be reported.  The
following additional actions can be specified with the report command:

  badtoken    A bad token identifier was given with the accept command.
  bounce      A bounce to the list owner that had a recognized address.
  connect     A connection failed due to the GLOBAL configuration settings.
  consult     A consult token was accepted for a posted message.
  expire      The lifetime of a request that required approval expired,
              and its token identifier was removed from the database.
  newtoken    A new token identifier has been added to the token database.
  parse       A message was sent to the server that contained no valid commands.
  ALL         Report everything.

The actions can optionally be followed by a colon or pipe (':', '|') and
one or more results.  The possible results are "succeed," "stall,"
"fail," or "all."  For example, the following command will show a report
of all successful posts made to the bismuth mailing list during the last
12 days:

  report bismuth 12d post : succeed

Actions and results can be combined with comma-separated lists.  For
example, the following command will show a report of all stalled and
failed subscription and unsubscription attempts on the cannabis list
during the last 36 hours:

  report cannabis 36h subscribe,unsubscribe : stall,fail

It is also possible to use multiple action/result criteria with a here
document.  The following command would have the same result as the
previous command:

report cannabis 36h <<ABC
subscribe : stall,fail
unsubscribe : stall, fail
ABC

Normally, when events are reported individually, the command, address
from which the request was made, result of the command, date, time and
elapsed time are displayed.  If the "full" command mode is used, the
interface and session number will also be displayed, on a separate line.
The session number is especially useful for determining what caused
a "bounce" (delivery failure).  Please see "help sessioninfo" for more
details.

Log entries that are older than the number of days in the log_lifetime
configuration setting are removed automatically.  Consequently, the
report command is only useful for monitoring recent events.

   help admin_monitor
   help configset_access_rules (to limit access to this command)

   help configset_log_lifetime
