EXAMPLE:
  report-summary nectarine 12h ALL

Activity for nectarine from 2000-08-03 02:53 to 2000-08-03 14:53
     Command:   Total  Succeed Stall Fail 
    announce:    7      6       0     1 
         faq:    1      1       0     0 
      report:    2      1       0     1 
         who:    1      1       0     0 

The "report" command displays raw or summarized data for recent log
entries for a mailing list, and can be constrained by action or date.
The "summary" command mode results in a table summarizing how many of each
kind of event occurred.  Otherwise, each event is reported.

The specified "listname" can be any regular list, or "ALL" to report
on all mailing lists, or one of the pseudo-lists "DEFAULT" or "GLOBAL".
Reporting on "GLOBAL" will inform you about commands such as accept,
reject, lists, which, and help. Reporting on "DEFAULT" shows commands that
act on the system defaults, like "configset DEFAULT". Reporting on a
regular list will inform you about things like subscription requests
and attempts to post.

If you specify a "date" field, the report will be restricted to a
period of time. Without "date", all events since the software was
installed will be reported. Dates can be specified in several formats:
 1. for the last N hours, days, weeks, months, or years, use the
    format shown in the "Time Period" section of "help times".
    For example, "3h" reports on events during the last 3 hours.
 2. for a given year, month, week, or day, use the format shown in
    the "Time Stamp" section of "help times". For example, "200007"
    reports on events during the month of July 2000.

The "inform" command mode will cause the actions for which "report" is
specified in the inform configuration setting to be displayed.  Any
actions specified in the report command itself will have no influence
on the output.

If you specify majordomo commands in a comma-separated list of actions,
only those types of events will be reported. If you specify no actions,
or if you use "ALL" as the action, all events will be reported.  See 
"help topics" for a list of commands that can be reported.  The following 
additional actions can be specified with the report command:

  badtoken    A bad token identifier was given with the accept command.
  bounce      A bounce to the list owner that had a recognized address.
  connect     A connection failed due to the GLOBAL configuration settings.
  consult     A consult token was accepted for a posted message.
  parse       A message was sent to the server that contained no valid commands.
  ALL         Report everything.

The actions can optionally be followed by a colon or pipe (':', '|') and
one or more results.  The possible results are "succeed," "stall," "fail,"
or "all."  For example, the following command will show a report of all 
successful posts made to the bismuth mailing list during the last 12 days:

  report bismuth 12d post : succeed

Actions and results can be combined with comma-separated lists.  For example,
the following command will show a report of all stalled and failed subscription
and unsubscription attempts on the cannabis list during the last 36 hours:

  report cannabis 36h subscribe,unsubscribe : stall,fail

It is also possible to use multiple action/result criteria with a here
document.  The following command would have the same result as the previous
command:

report cannabis 36h <<ABC
subscribe : stall,fail
unsubscribe : stall, fail
ABC

Log entries that are older than the number of days in the log_lifetime
configuration setting are removed automatically.  Consequently, the report 
command is only useful for monitoring recent events.

   help accept
   help admin_monitor
   help configset_access_rules (to limit access to this command)
   help configset_inform
   help configset_log_lifetime
