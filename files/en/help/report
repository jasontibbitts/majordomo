EXAMPLE:
  report-summary nectarine ALL 12h

Activity for nectarine from 2000-08-03 02:53 to 2000-08-03 14:53
     Command: Total  (Succeed/Stall/Fail)
    announce:    7   (   6/   0/   1)
         faq:    1   (   1/   0/   0)
      report:    2   (   1/   0/   1)
         who:    1   (   1/   0/   0)

The "report" command obtains raw or summarized data for recent log
entries for a mailing list, and can be constrained by action or date.
The "-summary" switch results in a table summarizing how many of each
kind of event occurred, and without the switch each event is reported.

The specified "listname" can be any regular list, or "ALL" to report
on all regular lists, or one of the pseudo-lists "DEFAULT" or "GLOBAL".
Reporting on "GLOBAL" will inform you about commands such as accept,
reject, lists, which, help. Reporting on "DEFAULT" shows commands that
act on the system defaults, like "configset DEFAULT". Reporting on a
regular list will inform you about things like subscription requests
and attempts to post.

If you specify majordomo commands in a comma-separated list of actions,
only those types of events will be reported. If you specify no actions,
or if you use "ALL" as the action, all events except "bounce" and
"trigger" will be reported. See "help topics" for a list of commands
that can be reported, and note that these ADDITIONAL actions can be
specified with the report command:
  badtoken:   A bad token was given with the accept command.
  bounce:     A bounce to the list owner that had an identified address.
  consult:    A consult token was accepted.
  connect:    A connection failed due to the GLOBAL 'access' setting.
  ALL:        Everything except for 'bounce' and 'trigger.'

If you specify a "date" field, the report will be restricted to a
period of time. Without "date", all events since the software was
installed will be reported. Dates can be specified in many formats:
 1. for the last N hours, days, weeks, months, or years, use:
   3h for 3 hours
   7d for 7 days
   2w for 2 weeks
   6m for 6 months
   2y for 2 years
   NOTE: If you need more accuracy in specifying time spans, you
         can combine these, as in 2w8h for two weeks and eight hours.
 2. for a given year, month, or day, use "yyyymmdd" as follows:
   1999     for the year  of           1999
   200007   for the month of    July   2000
   20000802 for the day   of 02 August 2000
 3. for a given week, use "yyyymmw" as follows:
   2000011 for the first week of January 2000
NOTE: There is a subtle difference between day and week time periods...
days are always two digits, weeks are always one digit! (this is the
same date syntax found in "help archive")
