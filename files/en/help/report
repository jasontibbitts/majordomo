EXAMPLE:
  report-summary nectarine 12h ALL
might display the following report:

Activity for nectarine from 2000-08-03 02:53 to 2000-08-03 14:53
     Command:   Total  Succeed Stall Fail  Time
    announce:    7      6       0     1    1.375
         faq:    1      1       0     0    0.849
      report:    2      1       0     1    5.439 
         who:    1      1       0     0    2.247

The "report" command displays raw or summarized data for recent log
entries for a mailing list, and can be constrained by action or date.
The "summary" command mode results in a table summarizing how many of
each kind of event occurred.  Otherwise, each event is reported.

The specified "listname" can be any regular list, or "ALL" to report on
all mailing lists, or one of the pseudo-lists "DEFAULT" or "GLOBAL".
Reporting on "GLOBAL" will inform you about commands such as accept,
reject, lists, which, and help. Reporting on "DEFAULT" shows commands
that act on the system defaults, like "configset DEFAULT". Reporting on
a regular list will inform you about things like subscription requests
and attempts to post.

If you specify a "date" field, the report will be restricted to a
period of time. Without "date", all events since the software was
installed will be reported. Dates can be specified in several formats:
 1. for the last N hours, days, weeks, months, or years, use the
    format shown in the "Time Period" section of "help times".
    For example, "3h" reports on events during the last 3 hours.
 2. for a given year, month, week, or day, use the format shown in
    the "Time Stamp" section of "help times". For example, "200007"
    reports on events during the month of July 2000.

The "inform" command mode will cause the actions for which "report" is
specified in the inform configuration setting to be displayed.  Any
actions specified in the report command itself will have no influence on
the output.

If you specify majordomo commands in a comma-separated list of actions,
only those types of events will be reported. If you specify no actions,
or if you use "ALL" as the action, all events will be reported.  See
"help topics" for a list of commands that can be reported.  The
following additional actions can be specified with the report command:

  badtoken    A bad token identifier was given with the accept command.
  bounce      A bounce to the list owner that had a recognized address.
  connect     A connection failed due to the GLOBAL configuration settings.
  consult     A consult token was accepted for a posted message.
  expire      The lifetime of a request that required approval expired,
              and its token identifier was removed from the database.
  newtoken    A new token identifier has been added to the token database.
  parse       A message was sent to the server that contained no valid commands.
  probebounce A bounce probe message could not be delivered.
  tokenbounce A confirmation message could not be delivered.
  ALL         Report everything.

The actions can optionally be followed by a colon or pipe (':', '|') and
one or more results.  The possible results are "succeed," "stall,"
"fail," or "all."  For example, the following command will show a report
of all successful posts made to the bismuth mailing list during the last
12 days:

  report bismuth 12d post : succeed

Actions and results can be combined with comma-separated lists.  For
example, the following command will show a report of all stalled and
failed subscription and unsubscription attempts on the cannabis list
during the last 36 hours:

  report cannabis 36h subscribe,unsubscribe : stall,fail

It is also possible to use multiple action/result criteria with a here
document.  The following command would have the same result as the
previous command:

report cannabis 36h <<ABC
subscribe : stall,fail
unsubscribe : stall, fail
ABC

Normally, when events are reported individually, the command, address
from which the request was made, result of the command, date, time and
elapsed time are displayed.  If the "full" command mode is used, the
interface and session number will also be displayed, on a separate line.
The session number is especially useful for determining what caused
a "bounce" (delivery failure).  Please see "help sessioninfo" for more
details.

Log entries that are older than the number of days in the log_lifetime
configuration setting are removed automatically.  Consequently, the
report command is only useful for monitoring recent events.  The 
triggers configuration setting can be used to adjust the frequency with
which old log entries are removed; by default, this happens daily.


                            Special Events

Several events which are recorded in the log do not have a
corresponding Majordomo command.  Each of those events is described in
this section.

badtoken
--------
A GLOBAL "badtoken" failure is recorded when the accept command is used
with a valid token identifier that does not currently exist in the token
database.  This failure usually occurs when someone uses the accept
command with a token that has recently expired or has been accepted or
rejected by another person.  This error is only recorded if a token
identifier in the correct format is used.  See "help showtokens" and
"help tokeninfo" for an introduction to token identifiers.

bounce
------
A "bounce" event is recorded when an e-mail message cannot be delivered
to a subscriber of a mailing list or to someone who sent a Majordomo
command to the server.

connect
-------
A "connect" failure is recorded in the log when a message or command
cannot be completed due to the configuration settings of the GLOBAL
pseudo-list.  There are several situations in which this might occur:

  * Someone sends an e-mail message containing commands to the Majordomo 
    server, but the return address in the "From:" header of the message
    is missing or contains an invalid address.

  * Someone sends an e-mail message of any kind that is denied by
    the GLOBAL access rules for the "access" action.

  * Someone sends an e-mail message of any kind that contains a header
    that is listed in the GLOBAL block_headers configuration setting.

  * Someone attempts to access the web interface for list administrators
    using invalid information (mailing list name, password, or e-mail
    address).

consult
-------
A "consult" event is recorded when a moderator of a mailing list uses
the "accept" command to approve a posted message.  In the case of
multiple moderators, it is helpful to distinguish "consult" actions from
ordinary "accept" actions for the purpose of determining which moderator
approved which message.

expire
------
An "expire" event is recorded when a token identifier is removed
automatically from the token database because its lifetime has expired.
See "help configset_triggers" and "help token_lifetime" for more
information about the expiration of tokens.

newtoken
--------
A "newtoken" event is recorded whenever a command or posted message is
held, awaiting someone's approval.

parse
-----
A "parse" event is recorded when an e-mail message is processed for
commands by the command parser, but no commands are found.

probebounce
-----------
A "probebounce" event is recorded when a bounce probe message cannot be
delivered to the intended recipient.  Bounce probe messages are created
by the bounce rules; if the probebounce results in an address being
removed from a mailing list, an "unsubscribe" event is also recorded.
See "help configset_bounce_rules" for more information on probes.

tokenbounce
-----------
A "tokenbounce" event is recorded when a confirmation message cannot be
delivered to the intended recipient.  If the tokenbounce results in the
token ID being removed from the database, a "reject" event is also
recorded.

                               Interfaces

The report-full command will include information about the interface
that was used to execute a command.  The interfaces are listed in the
following table:

email           The Majordomo server address
email-command   The LIST-subscribe, LIST-unsubscribe, or another
                  e-mail address that runs a specific command
email-request   The LIST-request address
owner           The LIST-owner address
resend          A message was posted to a mailing list
token-fulfill   A delayed command was completed by the mj_trigger
                  program
trigger         The mj_trigger program
wwwadm          The web interface for list and domain administrators
wwwconfirm      The web interface for command confirmation
wwwusr          The web interface for subscribers

When a command is executed by the accept command, the prefix "token-" is
added to the interface name.  For example, a command executed by the
accept command in an e-mail message would be considered to be executed
from the "token-email" interface.
