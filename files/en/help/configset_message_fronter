This contains blocks of text, called fronters, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple fronters
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a fronter is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the fronters given here. The
frequency with which fronters appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_fronter_frequency".

The fronter text will undergo variable substitution (and possibly
auto-inclusion of OTHER files) as it is added to the message.
See "help variables" for a list of substitutions which are supported.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes
on a special significance if it is the first character on the line.
If it is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and
a blank line is written out (allowing you to imbed blank lines without
the server thinking you have started another fronter). If the first
character is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-',
the first '-' is removed without changing anything else. If the
second character is a printing character, the leading '-' is left
alone. Note that leading white space does NOT have to be escaped
with a dash, but it can be if you wish. This syntax applies only
to message_fronters and message_footers.

Note that for multipart messages, fronters appear as separate parts at
the beginning of the message and that fronters are not added at all to
single part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids
destroying the content of structured messages.)
