# message_fronter
# (empty)              [string_2darray] <resend,digest>
# This contains blocks of text, called fronters, that can be added to
# the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple fronters
# here by separating them by blank lines.  When a fronter is to be
# added, it is chosen at random from the fronters given here.
#
# The following strings can be placed in fronters; they well be
# converted to the appropriate text when the fronter is inserted into
# the message:
#
#   \$LIST    - the name of the list
#   \$VERSION - the version of Majordomo
#   \$SENDER  - the person who sent the message
# XXX (_SUBJECTS_) ???
#
# Note that for multipart messages, fronters appear as separate parts at
# the beginning of the message and that fronters are not added at all to
# single part message that are not of type text/plain.  (This avoids
# destroying the content of structured messages.)
#
# The frequency with which fronters appear can be controlled with the
# variable "message_fronter_frequency".
