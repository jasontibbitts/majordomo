This contains blocks of text, called fronters, that can be added to
the beginning of outgoing messages.  You can include multiple fronters
here by separating them by blank lines.  When a fronter is to be
added, it is chosen at random from the fronters given here. The
frequency with which fronters appear can be controlled with
"configset listname message_fronter_frequency".

The fronter text will undergo variable substitution as it is added to
the message.   The variables supported include the standard
substitutions, plus ARCNO, ARCURL, DATE, HOST, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT,
SUBSCRIBED, and USER.  See "help variables" for more information.  If
the "rewritefrom" flag is set for the author of the message, the USER
substitution will contain the author's rewritten address.  See "help
set" for more information on the rewritefrom flag.

Within the here document (between the tags), the '-' character takes
on a special significance if it is the first character on the line.
If it is the one and only character on the line, it is removed and
a blank line is written out (allowing you to imbed blank lines without
the server thinking you have started another fronter). If the first
character is '-' and the second is a space or a tab or another '-',
the first '-' is removed without changing anything else. If the
second character is a printing character, the leading '-' is left
alone. Note that leading white space does NOT have to be escaped
with a dash, but it can be if you wish. This syntax applies only
to message_fronters and message_footers.

For multipart/mixed messages, fronters appear as separate parts at the
beginning of the message.  Message fronters are never added to other
kinds of multipart messages.

Fronters are not added at all to single-part messages that are not of
type text/plain.  This avoids destroying the content of structured
messages.
