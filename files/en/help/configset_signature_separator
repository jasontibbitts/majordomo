EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL signature_separator = /^[-_]/


The command parser will stop looking for commands when it sees a
line matching this pattern.

The standard signature separator is a line consisting only of
two dashes followed by one space. However, many users ignore
this standard and many sites use underscores instead of dashes.
Hence a more lenient pattern is generally more useful.
