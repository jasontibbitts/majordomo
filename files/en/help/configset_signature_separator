The text parser will stop looking for commands when it sees a line
matching this pattern.

The standard signature separator is a line consisting only of two
dashes followed by one space.  However, many users ignore this
standard and many sites use underscores instead of dashes.  Hence a
more lenient pattern is generally more useful.
