$INCLUDE-config/signature_separator

The standard signature separator is a line consisting only of
two dashes followed by one space. However, many users ignore
this standard and many sites use underscores instead of dashes.
Hence a more lenient pattern is generally more useful.

Some documents, such as the confirmation messages that are sent to
the moderators of a mailing list, start with "__ ".  This prevents
Majordomo from processing the commands in the confirmation message
instructions by accident.  Keep this in mind if you change the value 
of the signature_separator setting.
