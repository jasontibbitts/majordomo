$INCLUDE-config/welcome_files

The first line of each file description will be displayed in the Subject
header of a message if the file is the first file to appear in a welcome
message.  Otherwise, the first line will appear in a Content-Description
header of an attachment to the welcome message.

The first field of the second line of a file description is a file name.
The file must already be present in the file space of your mailing list.
The "get" command can be used to verify that the file exists:

  get-immediate LISTNAME FILENAME

Files can be created in the file space using the "put" command.

The second field of the second line of a file description is an optional
flag field.  Two flags are supported:  an 'N' indicates that the file
should be the first part of a new welcome message; an 'S' causes the
file to undergo variable substitution (and possibly auto-inclusion of
additional files).  The variables supported include the standard
substitutions, plus USER and PASSWORD.  See "help variables" for a
description of each substitution variable.  Regardless of whether the
'S' flag is present, the substitutions will be applied to the subject
from the first line of the description.

Here is another example:

configset LISTNAME welcome_files <<END
Welcome to the $LIST mailing list!
welcome
Picture of the list owner!
owner.jpg 
Q and A for the $LIST mailing list
/faq : NS
END

In this example, two welcome messages will be sent to new subscribers.
The first welcome message consists of a file called "welcome" and an
attached photograph called "owner.jpg".  The second welcome message
consists of a single file called "/faq".

The GLOBAL welcome_files setting only applies to messages that are sent
when someone uses the "register" command.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
You can use comments as a reminder of what a file does or why
it was chosen, but comments have no impact on how the setting works.
