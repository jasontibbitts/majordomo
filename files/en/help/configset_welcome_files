A table containing a list of files and descriptions that should be
sent to new subscribers.

Each table record takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory
message, which will go in the subject or content-description header as
appropriate.  (If this is empty, the file's description will be used.)
The second is broken into fields by ":" or "|".

The first field is the name of the file, in the file space of the list.  

The second should be either "N", meaning that the file will be sent as
a separate piece of mail, or "P", meaning that the file will be
attached to the previous file.  The default is "N".  In addition, an
"S" can be added, indicating that the file should undergo variable
substitution.
Currently the following substitutions are supported:

 $USER    - the address of the user
 $LIST    - the list name
 $REQUEST - the list-request address
 $MJ      - the address of the majordomo server
 $OWNER   - the address of the list owner
 $MJOWNER - the address of the domain owner


Here is an example:

configset LISTNAME welcome_files <<END
Welcome to the mailing list!
welcome
Picture of the list owner!
owner.jpg : P
Mailing list FAQ
faq.txt
END

   help help put  (for how to store files in the list's file space)
   help help configset filedir (for where the list's file space is)

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message

to the server at $MJ
