# welcome_files
# (empty)              [welcome_files] <majordomo,welcome>
#
# A table containing a list of files and descriptions that should be
# sent to new subscribers.
#
# Each table record takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory
# message, which will go in the subject or content-description header as
# appropriate.  (If this is empty, the file's description will be used.)
# The second is broken into fields by ":" or "|".
#
# The first field is the name of the file, in the file space of the list.
#
# The second should be either "N", meaning that the file will be sent as
# a separate piece of mail, or "P", meaning that the file will be
# attached to the previous file.  The default is "N".  In addition, an
# "S" can be added, indicating that the file should undergo variable
# substitution.
