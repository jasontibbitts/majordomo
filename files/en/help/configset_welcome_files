A table containing a list of files and descriptions that should be
sent to new subscribers.

Each table record takes two lines.  The first should be an explanatory
message, which will go in the subject or content-description header as
appropriate.  (If this is empty, the file's description will be used.)
The second is broken into a filename and a flag field by ":" or "|".

The first field on the second line of a record is the name of the file,
in the file space of the list. The second should be either "N", meaning
that the file will be sent as a separate piece of mail, or "P", meaning
that the file will be attached to the previous file.  The default is "N".

If the "N" or "P" in the second field of the second line is followed by
an "S", the file will undergo variable substitution (and possibly
auto-inclusion of OTHER files). See "help variables" for a list of
substitutions which are supported, but be aware that without the "S"
no substitutions will be done on the subject or body of the email.

Here is another example:

configset LISTNAME welcome_files <<END
Welcome to the mailing list!
welcome
Picture of the list owner!
owner.jpg : P
Mailing list FAQ
faq.txt
END

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
You can use comments as a reminder of what a file does or why
it was chosen, but comments have no impact on how the setting works.
