The debug value affects the mail aliases for a list, as determined by
the aliases configuration setting.  Therefore, if the debug value is
changed, the createlist-regen command should be run to regenerate the
aliases.

The debug value is used by the e-mail processing programs, mj_email,
mj_enqueue, and mj_queuerun, for all e-mail messages.  The debug value
has no effect upon the other interfaces (WWW, shell, etc.).

The GLOBAL debug value affects messages that are sent to the
Majordomo server address, $MJ.   

List-specific debug values affect messages that are
posted to a mailing list or sent to the other list-specific addresses,
such as the "owner" alias or the "request" alias.

Debugging information will be stored in several files in the GLOBAL
temporary.  This directory is controlled by the GLOBAL tmpdir
configuration setting.  Debugging information for e-mail messages is
stored in the following files:

  mj_email.debug    
  mj_enqueue.debug
  mj_majord.debug
  mj_queuerun.debug
  mj_queueserv.debug
  mj_request.debug
  mj_resend.debug

The other interfaces also have debugging logs in the same directory:

  mj_confirm.debug
  mj_trigger.debug
  mj_wwwadm.debug
  mj_wwwusr.debug

We recommend that the log files be rotated periodically to conserve disk
space.  The following unix shell commands offer one way to do that:
   cp FILE FILE.old
   cp /dev/null FILE

(Substitute the name of an actual log file for FILE.)
Majordomo has no built-in ability to rotate the logs.

Functions that are called very often and have very simple code or
predictable results are logged at a very high level so as to not
pollute the logging results. Generally, debug info is logged in
the following ranges:
   1   -  25: Emergencies anywhere.
   26  -  50: Important External interface functions
   51  - 100: Important core Majordomo functions
   101 - 150: Unimportant interface functions
   150 - 200: Unimportant core functions


                      Note to Majordomo developers

Consider just removing logging from anything you want to
put at a lower level, at least for production.  In fact, for production
we should probably make a script to comment out really low logging info.
