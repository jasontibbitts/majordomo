addendum to Majordomo2 "configset debug" File - updated 13 Feb 99

WARNING: Debug files in the tmpdir are not screened for security!
         They may contain sensitive information that even the
         average list owner should not have access to.

The "GLOBAL" pseudo-list setting refers to debugging of messages
sent to Majordomo. The "listname" setting turns on debugging for
resend and other per-list functions.

The "createlist-regen" command must be used whenever the value of
debug is changed. A complete list of suggested MTA configurations
for the site and each list is displayed. These aliases must be
installed for sendmail before debugging will become active.

The "debug" setting is NOT required for temporary debugging. You
can simply edit the aliases to add "-v500" instead of using
"configset listname debug = 500", for example, but setting debug
first has the advantage of keeping the debug setting the next
time you run "createlist-regen". (This applies to sendmail MTA,
others may vary in implementation.) See "help createlist" for
information on displaying and using the required aliases.

Once debugging is active, at the level of detail you choose, debug
info (perhaps a LOT of it) will accumulate in the place that you
told it to accumulate when you installed majordomo (probably /tmp
or /var/mj or something similar - see "help configset tmpdir_GLOBAL"
for how to change or set this directory). By default only a very
little bit of info will accumulate there.

These files are created in the Majordomo temporary directory when
you set "debug":
  mj_email.debug     - trace of actions related to subscriber commands
  mj_majord.debug    - trace of actions related to list owner commands
  mj_resend.debug    - trace of actions related to sending posts
  mj_trigger.debug   - time-based actions, as with digests and tokens

It is recommended that the *.debug log files should be reset by
   cp logfile logfile.old
   cat /dev/null > logfile
This will leave the file ownership and protection "as is", both of
which are crucial to collecting debug information. Use standard Unix
utilities like "cron" to reset these files, since Majordomo does not
EVER clean them up!

If someone with Unix shell access sets up the system correctly, it
is possible to "index" and "get" the debug files through the email
interface. By default, only shell users can access the debug files.
For a description of the contents and use of debug files and OTHER
files which can be left in the "tmpdir" when problems occur, please
refer to "help configset tmpdir_GLOBAL".
