listname, required, is an email list at this site (or the word "GLOBAL")
-enhanced, if specified, displays flags and mail mode for each subscriber
-short,    if specified, produces just a simple list of email addresses
-export,   if specified, produces commands needed to recreate the list
-bounce,   if specified, shows only addresses with bounces
-common,   if specified, shows addresses that appear on both lists
-alias,    if specified, produces commands needed to recreate the alias database
-owners,   if specified, shows the addresses of list owners and their lists.
pattern,   if specified, is an address matching string
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The "who" command returns all or some subscribers to the named list,
if you are authorized to review the subscribers. Each list owner may
decide who is authorized, and you will receive an error message if
you have been refused access.

If "GLOBAL" is used as the list name, the registry information is
returned instead of information from a specific list.  There are
two exceptions to this rule.  If a sublist is named, subscriber
data for the sublist are shown.  If the "owners" command mode is
used, the addresses are taken from the "owners" configuration
setting for each mailing list, instead of the registry.

If "pattern" is not supplied, all subscribers are listed.

If "pattern" is supplied, only addresses which match the pattern
will be listed. Beware of case sensitivity, and review the
"help patterns" file carefully. Patterns can be very simple or
full-blown Perl regular expressions.

If "-short" is specified, the simple list of addresses can be used
for administrative changes in a pipe. For example:
  mj_shell -p pass who-short listname | mj_shell -p pass -f - set listname ackimportant
can be used to alter the subscription options of all list subscribers.

If "-enhanced" is specified, additional information will be provided
about each subscriber in the list.  If the list name is GLOBAL, the
mailing lists in which the subscriber participates will be shown.
For any other list name, the subscriber flags and mail mode (each,
digest, or nomail) will be shown in the result.  The "enhanced"
option is only available to people using administrative passwords.

If "-export" is specified, with a password but without the need for
a wildcard pattern, the information will be provided in the form of
commands which will recreate the list (locally or at another site).
For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, the "-export" causes a group of 
"register" commands to be displayed. For regular lists, 
"-export" yields a bunch of subscribe and set commands.
Flag state and class (see "help set") are exported, as are nomail
expiration times. 

If "-alias" is specified in combination with the GLOBAL list, commands
will be displayed that would allow the GLOBAL aliases database to
be reconstructed.

If "-bounce" is specified, only those addresses with bounces being
processed will be shown. Refer to "help configset bounce_max_age"
for additional information on bounce processing (including other
commands related to bounces).

The "who-common" command displays addresses that appear on two
different mailing lists.  The data shown with the addresses,
if "enhanced" mode is used, are only relevant to the first of
the two lists.  This feature is useful for viewing the registration
data for people subscribed to a particular list:
  who-common-enhanced GLOBAL listname

The "who-owners GLOBAL" command will display the addresses of
all list owners within a domain, and a list of the mailing lists
maintained by each list owner.  The GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list
is automatically updated by this command.  Once this occurs, a
site or domain manager can contact every list owner with the 
announce command.

List owners can also view addresses in collections called "auxiliary 
subscriber lists" (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details.)
