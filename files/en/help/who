The who command displays a list of some or all of the subscribers of a
mailing list.  Access to this command may be restricted by the list 
administrators.

If a "pattern" is supplied, only addresses which match the pattern will be
listed. Please see "help patterns" for an introduction to Majordomo 
patterns.

If a "pattern" is not supplied, all subscribers will be listed.

The "short" command mode will cause only the names and addresses of the
subscribers to be displayed, without any extra formatting.


                 Command Modes for List Administrators

Several modes of the who command require an administrative password.

If the "enhanced" command mode is specified, additional information will 
be provided about each subscriber in the list.  If the list name is GLOBAL, 
the mailing lists in which the subscriber participates will be shown.  For
any other list name, the subscriber flags and delivery class (each, digest,
nomail) will be shown in the result.  The subscriber flags are presented
in an abbreviated form, with one letter for each flag that is set,
according to the following table:

Letter  Setting Name
  d      ackdeny     
  f      ackpost
  j      ackreject
  b      ackstall
  C      eliminatecc
  h      hideaddress
  H      hideall
  N      hidepost
  O      postblock
  P      prefix
  R      replyto
  W      rewritefrom
  S      selfcopy

Please see "help set" for an explanation of each setting.

The "export" command mode will cause the subscriber list to be displayed
as a collection of Majordomo commands which can be used to recreate the
subscriber list, including all of the settings for each subscription.
For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, export mode causes a group of "register"
commands to be displayed. For regular lists, export mode shows a bunch
of subscribe and set commands.  

If "bounce" mode is specified, only those addresses that have
experienced delivery failures will be shown. Refer to 
"help configset_bounce_max_age" for additional information on bounce 
processing (including other commands related to bounces).

If "GLOBAL" is used as the list name, the registry information is
returned instead of information from a specific list.  There are three
exceptions to this rule.  If a sublist is named, subscriber data for the
sublist are shown.  If the "owners" command mode is used, the addresses
are taken from the "owners" configuration setting for each mailing list,
instead of the registry.  If the "alias" command mode is used, the
addresses are taken from the GLOBAL aliases database (see "help alias"
for more information about aliases.)

The "who-common" command displays addresses that appear on two different
mailing lists.  The data shown with the addresses, if "enhanced" mode is
used, are only relevant to the first of the two lists.  This feature is
useful for viewing the registration data for people subscribed to a
particular list: 
  who-common-enhanced GLOBAL LISTNAME
or the aliases for one list's subscribers:
  who-common-alias GLOBAL LISTNAME
(A valid mailing list name should be substituted for LISTNAME.)

The "who-summary" command will display a summary of statistics.  For
the GLOBAL pseudo-list, the number of subscribers of each mailing list
that has subscribers will be displayed.  In addition, the number of
registered addresses with no subscriptions will be displayed for the
(fictitious) "NONE" list.  In the context of a single list, the number
of subscribers in each delivery class will be displayed (see "help set"
for a description of delivery classes.)

The "who-owners GLOBAL" command will display the addresses of all list
owners within a domain, and a list of the mailing lists maintained by
each list owner.  The GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list is automatically
updated by this command.  Once this occurs, a site or domain manager can
contact every list owner with the announce command.

List owners can also view addresses in collections called "auxiliary
subscriber lists" (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details.)

The "short" command mode can be used for administrative changes in a pipe. 
For example, the following shell command:

  mj_shell -p PASSWORD who-short LISTNAME \
  | mj_shell -p PASSWORD -f - set LISTNAME eliminatecc

can be used to alter the subscription options of all list subscribers.
(This shell command has the same effect as the following Majordomo command:

  approve PASSWORD set-pattern-allmatching LISTNAME eliminatecc ALL

In these commands, substitute an administrative password for PASSWORD
and the name of a mailing list for LISTNAME.  See "help set" and 
"help mj_shell" for more details.)

If the who command is accessible to list members or to the public, 
individual list members can hide their addresses and names from other
list members or the public.  See the descriptions of the "hideall"
and "hideaddress" flags in the "help set" document for more details.
