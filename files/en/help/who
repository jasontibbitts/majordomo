listname, required, is an email list at this site
-short,  if specified, produces just a simple list of email addresses
pattern, if specified, is a matching string (see "help patterns")

The "who" command returns all or some subscribers to the named list,
if you are authorized to review the subscribers. Each list owner may
decide who is authorized, and you will receive an error message if
you have been refused access.

If "pattern" is not supplied, all subscribers are listed.

If "pattern" is supplied, beware of case sensitivity, and review
the "help patterns" file carefully. Patterns can be very simple or
full-blown Perl regular expressions.

If "-short" is specified, the simple list of addresses can be used
for administrative changes in a pipe. For example:
  mj_shell -p pass who-short | mj_shell -p pass -f - set listname ackimportant
can be used to alter the subscription options of all list subscribers.
