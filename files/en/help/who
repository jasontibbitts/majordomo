listname, required, is an email list at this site (or the word "GLOBAL")
-enhanced, if specified, displays flags and mail mode for each subscriber
-short,    if specified, produces just a simple list of email addresses
-export,   if specified, produces commands needed to recreate the list
-bounce,   if specified, shows only addresses with bounces
-common,   if specified, shows addresses that appear on both lists
-alias,    if specified, produces commands needed to recreate the alias database
-owners,   if specified, shows the addresses of list owners and their lists.
pattern,   if specified, is an address matching string

The who command displays a list of some or all of the subscribers of a
mailing list.  Access to this command may be restricted by the list 
administrators.

If a "pattern" is supplied, only addresses which match the pattern will be
listed. Please see "help patterns" for an introduction to Majordomo 
patterns.

If a "pattern" is not supplied, all subscribers are listed.

The "short" command mode will cause only the names and addresses of the
subscribers to be displayed, without any extra formatting.


                 Command Modes for List Administrators

Several modes of the who command require an administrative password.

If the "enhanced" command mode is specified, additional information will 
be provided about each subscriber in the list.  If the list name is GLOBAL, 
the mailing lists in which the subscriber participates will be shown.  For
any other list name, the subscriber flags and delivery class (each, digest,
nomail) will be shown in the result.  The subscriber flags are presented
in an abbreviated form, with one letter for each flag that is set,
according to the following table:

Letter  Setting Name
  d      ackdeny     
  f      ackpost
  j      ackreject
  b      ackstall
  C      eliminatecc
  h      hideaddress
  H      hideall
  N      hidepost
  O      postblock
  P      prefix
  R      replyto
  W      rewritefrom
  S      selfcopy

Please see "help set" for an explanation of each setting.

The "export" command mode will cause the subscriber list to be displayed
as a collection of Majordomo commands which can be used to recreate the
subscriber list, including all of the settings for each subscription.
For the GLOBAL pseudo-list, export mode causes a group of "register"
commands to be displayed. For regular lists, export mode shows a bunch
of subscribe and set commands.  

If "bounce" mode is specified, only those addresses that have
experienced delivery failures will be shown. Refer to 
"help configset_bounce_max_age" for additional information on bounce 
processing (including other commands related to bounces).

If "GLOBAL" is used as the list name, the registry information is
returned instead of information from a specific list.  There are three
exceptions to this rule.  If a sublist is named, subscriber data for the
sublist are shown.  If the "owners" command mode is used, the addresses
are taken from the "owners" configuration setting for each mailing list,
instead of the registry.  If the "alias" command mode is used, the
addresses are taken from the GLOBAL aliases database (see "help alias"
for more information about aliases.)

The "who-common" command displays addresses that appear on two different
mailing lists.  The data shown with the addresses, if "enhanced" mode is
used, are only relevant to the first of the two lists.  This feature is
useful for viewing the registration data for people subscribed to a
particular list: 
  who-common-enhanced GLOBAL LISTNAME
(A valid mailing list name should be substituted for LISTNAME.)

The "who-owners GLOBAL" command will display the addresses of all list
owners within a domain, and a list of the mailing lists maintained by
each list owner.  The GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list is automatically
updated by this command.  Once this occurs, a site or domain manager can
contact every list owner with the announce command.

List owners can also view addresses in collections called "auxiliary
subscriber lists" (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details.)

The "short" command mode can be used for administrative changes in a pipe. 
For example, the following command:
  mj_shell -p pass who-short listname | mj_shell -p pass -f - set listname ackimportant
can be used to alter the subscription options of all list subscribers.
