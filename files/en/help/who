listname, required, is an email list at this site (or the word "GLOBAL")
-enhanced, if specified, displays flags and mail mode for each subscriber
-short,    if specified, produces just a simple list of email addresses
-export,   if specified, produces commands needed to recreate the list
-bounces,  if specified, shows only addresses with bounces
pattern,   if specified, is a matching string (see "help patterns")

The "who" command returns all or some subscribers to the named list,
if you are authorized to review the subscribers. Each list owner may
decide who is authorized, and you will receive an error message if
you have been refused access.

If "GLOBAL" is used as the list name, the registry information is
returned instead of information from a specific list.

If "pattern" is not supplied, all subscribers are listed.

If "pattern" is supplied, beware of case sensitivity, and review
the "help patterns" file carefully. Patterns can be very simple or
full-blown Perl regular expressions.

If "-short" is specified, the simple list of addresses can be used
for administrative changes in a pipe. For example:
  mj_shell -p pass who-short listname | mj_shell -p pass -f - set listname ackimportant
can be used to alter the subscription options of all list subscribers.

If "-enhanced" is specified, additional information will be provided
about each subscriber in the list.  If the list name is GLOBAL, the
mailing lists in which the subscriber participates will be shown.
For any other list name, the subscriber flags and mail mode (each,
digest, or nomail) will be shown in the result.  The "enhanced"
option is only available to people using administrative passwords.

If "-export" is specified, with a password but without the need for
a wildcard pattern, the information will be provided in the form of
commands which will recreate the list (locally or at another site).
In other words, you get a big pile of subscribe and set commands.
Flag state and class (see "help set") are exported, as are nomail
expiration times. The commands don't include any mention of the list
they apply to, so just stick 'default password' and 'default list'
at the top and you're ready to go. Interaction with registration
isn't done; this means that passwords must be reissued at the new site.

If "-bounces" is specified, only those addresses with bounces being
processed will be shown. Refer to "help configset bounce_max_age"
for additional information on bounce processing (including other
commands related to bounces).
