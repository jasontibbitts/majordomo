EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL password_min_length = 6


This sets the minimum length for user passwords.  This takes effect
when a user is setting their password; passwords generated randomly
will always be six characters long (currently).  There is no maximum
password length, but for security reasons it is wise to enforce a
lower limit.
