This setting is useful for making a list unavailable to the public
when it is first created.  The list owners can make configuration
changes, write the welcome message and other documents, and take other
preparatory steps that are needed before the list is made public.

Another use of this setting is to stop a mailing list temporarily
if a serious problem such as a mail loop or denial of service attack
occurs.

An administrative password can be used to issue commands for a mailing
list, regardless of the value of this setting.

This setting will override any rules in the access_rules setting.
