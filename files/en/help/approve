The "approve" command executes another command (possibly with its own
options and arguments). Majordomo checks the supplied password, and
if it is authorized to approve the given command, that command will be
executed without requiring a confirmation token to be accepted.

List subscribers can use it to speed the subscribe and unsubscribe
process, or to unsubscribe from a new email address when the old
address is no longer usable (assuming they saved their password!).

The 'default' command can make it much easier to approve several
commands at once. Most admin commands are of little use without
"approve" and the appropriate password. If an admin command fails,
check to make sure you are approving it correctly.

In the example below, "vespa" is the registered user's password.
EXAMPLE:
   approve vespa unsubscribe test-list tsmith@example.com

   help accept   (which may be required if approve is not used)
   help default  (which can supply a password for many commands)
   help password (which changes an individual's password)
