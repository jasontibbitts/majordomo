The approve command is used to specify a password for a single Majordomo
command.  The password can be either an administrative password or a
personal password.  The command for which the password is supplied must
begin on the same line as the approve command.

EXAMPLE:
   approve vespa unsubscribe test-list tsmith@example.com

In this example, the password "vespa" is used to cause the "unsubscribe"
request to be carried out immediately.  Usually, attempting to
unsubscribe an address without using a password would cause a
confirmation message to be sent to the address being unsubscribed or to
the list administrators.

The "default password" command can make it much easier to approve
several commands at once.
