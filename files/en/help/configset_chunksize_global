(extracted on 7 Mar 1999 from configshow-comments, default value is below)

# chunksize
# (1000)               [integer] <majordomo>
# This controls the size of various internal structures.  Lowering this
# value saves memory and decreases performance.  Setting it to 0
# disables internal chunking, and can use very large amounts of memory.
configset GLOBAL chunksize = 1000
