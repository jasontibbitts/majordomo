EXAMPLE:
configset listname subject_prefix = [\$LIST: \$SEQNO]


The contents of this setting will be prefixed to the Subject header
of every message that is posted to a mailing list.  Only subscribers
with the prefix setting will see the prefix (see "help set" for 
more information). This value supports the standard variable substitutions, 
plus the \$SEQNO substitution (see "help variables" for more details).

When deciding if the prefix text is already in the subject, Majordomo
ignores leading tags like "Re:" and "FWD:" that are commonly used for
indicating replies. If non-standard prefixes have been inserted before
the existing Majordomo prefix, a duplicate prefix may be added.
