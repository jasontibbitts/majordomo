EXAMPLE:
configset listname subject_prefix = Mj2:$LIST


This word will be prefixed to the subject line, if it is not already
in the subject. The subject text will undergo variable substitution
as it is added to the message. See "help variables" for a list of
substitutions which are supported.

When deciding if the prefix text is already in the subject, Majordomo
ignores leading tags like "Re:" and "FWD:" that are commonly used for
indicating replies. If non-standard prefixes have been inserted before
the existing Majordomo prefix, a duplicate prefix may be added.
