EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/subject_prefix

The prefix will only be added to copies of a message that are delivered
to subscribers with the "prefix" setting turned on.  The prefix will
automatically be removed from copies of a message that are delivered to
subscribers with the "prefix" setting turned off.  See "help set" for
more information on personal settings. 

This setting supports the standard substitution variables, plus the
\$SEQNO substitution.  See "help variables" for an introduction to
substitution variables.

The subject_prefix setting only affects the subject headers of messages
that are delivered individually.  See "help configset_digests" for
details on customizing the subject header of message digests.
