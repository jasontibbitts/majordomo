EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL sender = majordomo-owner


The envelope and sender address for the resent mail.  This string has
"@" and the value of resend_host appended to it to make a complete
address.  For majordomo, it provides the sender address for the
welcome mail message generated as part of the subscribe command.
If you set this address to LISTNAME-owner, replies to welcome text
go to the list owner. If you comment the "configset sender" command
out, replies go to the server. This often cuts down on random traffic
for people who want to "set" their subscription options or unsubscribe.

Another reason NOT to use this command is that it fools AOL. We don't
know why, but you need to SUPPRESS the "sender: listname@where.org"
header for their reply-to-all to function. Other mail tools seem to
be OK either way.

Finally, this address seems to show up in some "accept" messages as
the "to reach a human" address. That's wrong, and the problem goes
away if you don't specify "configset sender" at all.
