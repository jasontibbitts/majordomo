EXAMPLE:

configset mylist sender =  mylist-owner

$INCLUDE-config/sender

Formally, this is the address used in "MAIL FROM" SMTP commands.  As a
result, most "bounce" messages caused by delivery failures will be sent
to this address.  Once the bounce messages have been processed, any
bounce messages that areintended to be read by a person will be sent to
the addresses in the bounce_recipients configuration setting.

The sender configuration setting is only used internally by Majordomo.
In contrast, the address in the whoami_owner configuration setting
frequently appears in the "From:" header of mail notices that are sent
by the Majordomo server.  For this reason, it is highly recommended that
you customize the whoami_owner configuration setting instead of changing
the sender configuration setting.

Although the "sender" address may appear in the "Sender:" header of some
e-mail messages, that header is usually added by the software that
performs the delivery (such as Sendmail), not by Majordomo.

If there is no domain given in the address, for example:
  configset mylist sender = webmaster
the domain in the GLOBAL whereami configuration setting is used.  If the
domain is example.com, the "webmaster" sender address would become
"webmaster@example.com" in this instance.
