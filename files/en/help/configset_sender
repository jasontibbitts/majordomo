EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL sender = majordomo-owner@yourdomain.net
configset mylist sender =    mylist-owner@yourdomain.net


The envelope and sender address for the resent mail.  This string has
"@" and the value of resend_host appended to it to make a complete
address if you do not supply a domain. When applied to the GLOBAL
pseudo-list, it provides the sender address for things like token
confirmation requests. When applied to a regular email list, it
supplies the sender address for regular posts in addition to the
welcome mail message generated as part of the subscribe command.

Formally, this is the address used in "Mail From" SMTP commands.
Practically, it should usually be a human (such as list-owner)
and the From or Reply-To fields of the header should be set up
so they control where replies go.

If you set this address to LISTNAME-owner, replies to welcome text
go to the list owner. If properly configured, with "configset
message_headers" or "configset reply_to", an extra Reply-To field
causes replies go to the server regardless of how "configset sender"
is used. This often cuts down on random traffic for people who want
to "set" their subscription options or unsubscribe, but it may also
cause usage questions to reach the server instead of the owner.
