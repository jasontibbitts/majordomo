EXAMPLE:

configset mylist sender = mylist-owner@yourdomain.net


The envelope and sender address for the resent mail.  This string has
"@" and the value of resend_host appended to it to make a complete
address if you do not supply a domain. When applied to the GLOBAL
pseudo-list, it provides the sender address for things like token
confirmation requests. When applied to a regular email list, it
supplies the sender address for regular posts in addition to the
welcome mail message generated as part of the subscribe command.

If you set this address to LISTNAME-owner, replies to welcome text
go to the list owner. If you comment the "configset sender" command
out, replies go to the server. This often cuts down on random traffic
for people who want to "set" their subscription options or unsubscribe,
but it may also cause usage questions to reach the server instead of
the owner.

One reason NOT to use this command is that it may fool AOL. We don't
know why, but at one time you needed to SUPPRESS the "sender"
header for their reply-to-all feature to work. Other mail tools seem
to be OK either way, because they use the FROM and REPLY-TO headers.
