The "whereami" configuration applies only to the GLOBAL pseudo-list.
You should set "whereami" to be the domain of the server, such as
"wherever.com" if you want users to send posts to addresses like
"listname@wherever.com".

In some cases email addresses can be fully qualified. The "whereami"
setting supplies domains when only a partial address is specified.
