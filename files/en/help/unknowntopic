You received this message because you requested a help topic that
Majordomo does not support.  Please check your spelling, and try again!

The "help" command returns a help file from the server, if help is
available for the requested topic. If the requested topic is not
available, this file is returned.

To get a list of all possible topics, send the following command:
   help topics
in the body of a message to $MJ.

To read an introduction to the help system, send the following command:
   help help
in the body of a message to $MJ.

All commands have help files, but you will probably want to start with
   help overview
if you are a list subscriber, or
   help admin
if you manage a mailing list, for a basic introduction to Majordomo.
