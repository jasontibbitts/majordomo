YOU RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE YOU SENT A HELP REQUEST THAT THE
SERVER CANNOT RESPOND TO. Please check the spelling, and try again.

The "help" command returns a help file from the server, if help is
available for the requested topic. If the requested topic is not
available, this file is returned.

To get a list of all possible topics, send the message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ and read carefully.

To get basic help, send this one-line message to $MJ
   help

All commands have help files, but you will probably want to start with
   help overview
if you are a list subscriber, or
   help admin
if you manage a list, to get an idea of which commands you want to use.

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
