The announce command sends a file to some or all classes of subscribers
of a full or auxiliary mailing list.  Delivering an announcement
may require more resources than a typical posted message, because a separate
copy of the announcement is sent to every recipient.  The recipient's 
address appears in the "To:" header, and the list owners' address 
(from the whoami_owner configuration setting) appears in the "From:" header.
The description of the file will appear in the "Subject:" header.  

The announce command could be used to deliver periodic reminders, announcements 
that need to reach only 'digest' subscribers, or to ask 'nomail' subscribers 
if they wish to stay on the list, for example.

The command mode (each, nomail, digest, unique) can be used to limit
the recipients to one or more classes of subscribers. The default is all 
classes.  Please see "help admin_subscribers" and "help set" for an 
introduction to delivery classes.

When an announcement is sent to the GLOBAL pseudo-list, the recipients
are chosen from Majordomo's central registry (see "help register" and
"help admin_domain" for an introduction to the registry).  The "each"
and "nomail" classes are used to distinguish people who are subscribed
to one or more mailing lists from those who are registered but not
subscribed to any mailing lists.

See "help put" and "help get" to learn how to create or edit a file, or
change its description.

The file that is distributed is a template that supports keyword
variable substitutions.  The variables supported include the standard 
substitutions, as documented in "help variables", plus \$REQUESTER and 
\$USER.  In addition, any unescaped occurrence of \$MSGRCPT will be replaced 
by the address of the recipient of each copy of the announcement. 
One way this could be used is to include a notice in the announcement
indicating the subscription address, such as:

  You are subscribed to the \$LIST list as \$MSGRCPT.


As an example, the command

  announce-nomail LISTNAME /expiration

could be used to send a notice about expiring inactive subscriptions to all 
people with postponed subscriptions.  The file "/expiration" must already
have been stored in the list's file space, using the put command.
