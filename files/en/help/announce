listname, required, is an email list at this site
filename, required, is the file to distribute
-each,   if specified, limits delivery to subscribers using "set each"
-nomail, if specified, limits delivery to subscribers using "set nomail"
-digest, if specified, limits delivery to subscribers using "set digest"
-unique, if specified, limits delivery to subscribers using "set unique"

Distribute a file individually to some or all classes of subscribers
of a (full, not auxiliary) mailing list. Each message is sent as a
probe, with the recipient in the "To:" header, so "announce" takes
more resources than "post". This could be used for periodic reminders,
announcements that need to reach 'digest' subscribers immediately, or
just a way to ask 'nomail' subscribers why they are still on the list.

The mode (each, nomail, digest, unique) specifies which class of subscribers
will receive the  message. The default is all classes. (When delivering
an announcement, the "each" and "nomail" classes are used to distinguish
addresses subscribed to one or more lists from those that aren't.)

Along with the announce command goes a special substitution
in the delivery module.  Any unescaped occurrence of
\$MSGRCPT will be replaced by the address of the recipient.
(See "help variables" for a complete list of variables that
can be substituted when files are sent by various commands.)
One way this could be used is to add a footer to the
end of each message:
  You are subscribed to the mj2-dev list as \$MSGRCPT.

The announce command uses \$MSGRCPT to change the To:
header of the announcement, so it contains the address
of the recipient instead of the address of the list.
The announce command also lets you choose which class
of recipients receives the announcement.  For instance,
  announce-nomail listname /expiration
could be used to send a notice about expiring inactive
subscriptions to all people with postponed subscriptions.
