This command sends a file to some or all classes of subscribers
of a full or auxiliary mailing list.  Delivering an announcement
may require more resources than a typical posted message:  a separate
copy of the announcement is sent to every recipient.  The recipient's 
address appears in the "To:" header, and the list owner's address 
(from the sender configuration setting) appears in the "From:" header.

The announce command could be used to deliver periodic reminders, announcements 
that need to reach only 'digest' subscribers, or to ask 'nomail' subscribers 
if they wish to stay on the list, for example.

The mode (each, nomail, digest, unique) specifies which class of subscribers
will receive the  message. The default is all classes. (When delivering
an announcement, the "each" and "nomail" classes are used to distinguish
addresses subscribed to one or more lists from those that aren't.)

The file that is distributed is a template that supports keyword
variable substitutions.  The variables supported include the standard 
substitutions, as documented in "help variables", plus \$REQUESTER and 
\$USER.  In addition, any unescaped occurrence of \$MSGRCPT will be replaced 
by the address of the recipient of each copy of the announcement. 
One way this could be used is to include a notice in the announcement
indicating the subscription address, such as:
  You are subscribed to the mj2-dev list as \$MSGRCPT.

The announce command uses \$MSGRCPT to change the To: header of the 
announcement, so it contains the address of the recipient instead of 
the address of the mailing list.  The announce command also lets you 
choose which class of recipients receives the announcement.  For instance,
  announce-nomail listname /expiration
could be used to send a notice about expiring inactive subscriptions to all 
people with postponed subscriptions (the "nomail" setting; see "help set"
for an explanation of the different delivery classes).
