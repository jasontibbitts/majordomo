listname, required, is an email list at this site
filename, required, is the file to distribute
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Distribute a file to one
or more classes of subscribers.  Each message is
sent as a probe, with the recipient in the To: header.
This could be used for periodic reminders, or
announcements that need to reach 'digest' and 'nomail'
subscribers immediately.

Finally, to accommodate periodic reminders, the announce command
allows a file to be sent individually to some or all classes
of subscribers to a (full, not auxiliary) mailing list.
The command looks something like this:
  announce listname faq

Along with the announce command goes a special substitution
in the delivery module.  Any unescaped occurrence of
\$MSGRCPT will be replaced by the address of the recipient.
One way this could be used is to add a footer to the
end of each message:

 You are subscribed to the mj2-dev list as \$MSGRCPT.

The tradeoff is that this feature is only available
when probing.  It will slow the speed of delivery.

The announce command uses \$MSGRCPT to change the To:
header of the announcement, so it contains the address
of the recipient instead of the address of the list.
The announce command also lets you choose which class
of recipients receives the announcement.  For instance,

  announce-nomail listname /expiration

could be used to send a notice about expiring inactive
subscriptions to all people with postponed subscriptions.
