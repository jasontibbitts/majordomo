# message_footer_frequency
# (100)                [integer] <resend>
# Controls how often a message_footer will be added to outgoing
# messages.  Set this to a number and on average footers will be added
# to that percentage of messagees.  If this is set to 100 or greater,
# footers will always be added.  If set to 0 or below, footers will
# never be added (even if footers are defined).
#
# Note that this only makes sense if one or more footers have been set
# in message_footer.  Note also that this only controls the probability
# that a footer will be added; the process itself is random.
