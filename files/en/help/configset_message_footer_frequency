EXAMPLE:
configset listname message_footer_frequency = 100


Controls how often a message_footer will be added to outgoing
messages.  Set this to a number and on average footers will be added
to that percentage of messagees.  If this is set to 100 or greater,
footers will always be added.  If set to 0 or below, footers will
never be added (even if footers are defined).

Note that this only makes sense if one or more footers have been set
in message_footer.  Note also that this only controls the probability
that a footer will be added; the process itself is random.
