addendum to Majordomo2 "configset filedir" File - updated 11 Feb 99

If you leave this variable undefined (e.g. nothing after the "="),
the "put" command will create files inside "listname/files/public"
by default, and inside "listname/files" if you start the put path
with a slash. See "help put" for details.

If you define this variable, you must make sure that Majordomo has
permission to access the directory and the files in it. Defining
"filedir" may affect many commands like "get", "put", "index", and
even "help" if you have stored files in the GLOBAL pseudo-list.
