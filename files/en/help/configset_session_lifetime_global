(extracted on 7 Mar 1999 from configshow-comments, default value is below)

# session_lifetime
# (14)                 [integer] <majordomo>
# The number of days that information on all Majordomo sessions will be
# kept.  Majordomo saves the complete headers of all emailed requests,
# and all pertinent information for other types of requests.  These
# files can occupy significant space on an active server, so they are
# purged after this many days.
