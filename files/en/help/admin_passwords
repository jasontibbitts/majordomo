Majordomo has two kinds of password, administrative and personal.  This
document describes administrative passwords.  For more information on
personal passwords, see "help password".

All passwords have a minimum length, which is determined by the GLOBAL
password_min_length configuration setting.  That length is 6 characters
by default.

There are five levels of administrative password:

5. The site master password, determined by the person who installed Majordomo
at your site.  A site master password can be used to manage any Majordomo 
mailing list in any virtual domain at the site.

4. Domain master passwords, one for each virtual domain, determined by the 
person who installed Majordomo at your site.  A domain password is stored
in the master_password setting for the GLOBAL pseudo-list.  The domain master
password can be used to manage any mailing list within a domain.

3. Domain auxiliary passwords, as defined by the GLOBAL passwords setting.
Auxiliary passwords can be limited to a small group of commands, or
restricted to one particular person.

2. List master passwords, one for each mailing list, assigned randomly 
when the createlist command is run.  A list master password is stored 
in the master_password configuration setting for each mailing list.

1. Domain auxiliary passwords, as defined by the list's passwords setting.
Auxiliary passwords can be limited to a small group of commands, or
restricted to one particular person.

With the exception of auxiliary passwords, which can optionally be tied to
particular e-mail addresses, it does not matter from which address you
issue commands.  Anyone who knows an administrative password for a mailing
list can manage that list.

When you issue administrative commands, it is usually necessary
to give your administrative password.  There are two ways to do
this.  The first is to prefix each command with the approve command.

Example:
  approve yourpassword subscribe listname someone@example.com

The second way is to use the default command to indicate the password
for the commands that follow.

Example:
  default password yourpassword
  subscribe listname someone@example.com

In each example, you must substitute your administrative password for
"yourpassword" and your mailing list's name for "listname."
