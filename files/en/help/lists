NOTE: Normally you would only specify one option, as in "lists-long",
but it is possible to combine them as in "lists-short-enhanced".
Proof is left to the user that any of these combinations are useful.

This command shows all the lists hosted at $MJ
unless the owner of a list has configured it to be invisible to you.
If you specify "pattern", only lists matching that regular expression
will be displayed (see "help patterns" for regular expression details).

If no options are used, the kind of list you get is determined by
the site administrator who can set the default to any option.
Combinations may yield useful results or may produce garbage output.

With the "-tiny" option, you get back only the list names no matter
what other options you may add to the command.

With the "-short" option, a one-line description of each list
is provided, and lists are grouped by area of interest, as
determined by the site administrator. Additional information
about the site is provided.

The "-long" option is similar to "-short", but a paragraph-length
description is shown for each list.

The "-compact" option is similar to "-long", but site information
and all blank lines are removed.

With the "-enhanced" option, you also get information about which
lists you are subscribed to. If only this option is used, you get
all the information from "-long".

The "-aux" option causes all sublists to be displayed.  Sublists,
also known as auxiliary lists, are used to categorize subscribers,
and to allow different groups of subscribers to have different 
privileges. Note that only sublists specified by the list owner
with "configset sublists" will appear in this listing.

The "-full" option causes extra information, including a subscriber
count, the URL of the list archives (if configured), the list posting
address, the owner address, etc. to be displayed.

To find out where you are subscribed without descriptive paragraphs:
  lists-enhanced-short
