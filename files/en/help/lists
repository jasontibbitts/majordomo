pattern,   if specified, is a regular expression to search list names
-aux,      if specified, shows all auxiliary lists also
-compact,  if specified, shows all lists without site information
-config,   if specified, shows all configuration templates also
-enhanced, if specified, marks the lists to which you are subscribed
-full,     if specified, shows all lists with maximal information
-long,     if specified, shows all lists with paragraph descriptions
-short,    if specified, shows all lists with one-line descriptions
-tiny,     if specified, shows all lists with minimal information

NOTE: Normally you would only specify one option, as in "lists-long",
but it is possible to combine them as in "lists-short-enhanced".
Proof is left to the user that any of these combinations are useful.

This command shows all the lists hosted at $MJ
unless the owner of a list has configured it to be invisible to you.
If you specify "pattern", only lists matching that regular expression
will be displayed (see "help patterns" for regular expression details).

If no options are used, the kind of list you get is determined by
the site administrator who can set the default to any option.
Combinations may yield useful results or may produce garbage output.

With the "-tiny" option, you get back only the list names no matter
what other options you may add to the command.

With the "-short" option, a one-line description of each list
is provided, and lists are grouped by area of interest, as
determined by the site administrator. Additional information
about the site is provided.

The "-long" option is similar to "-short", but a paragraph-length
description is shown for each list.

The "-compact" option is similar to "-long", but site information
and all blank lines are removed.

With the "-enhanced" option, you also get information about which
lists you are subscribed to. If only this option is used, you get
all the information from "-long".

To find out where you are subscribed without descriptive paragraphs:
  lists-enhanced-short

The "-full" option causes extra information, including a subscriber
count, the URL of the list archives (if configured), the list posting
address, the owner address, etc. to be displayed.

The "-aux" option causes all sublists to be displayed.  Sublists,
also known as auxiliary lists, are used to categorize subscribers,
and to allow different groups of subscribers to have different 
privileges. Note that only sublists specified by the list owner
with "configset sublists" will appear in this listing, unless
a list, domain, or site master password is used.

The "-config" option causes all configuration templates to be
displayed.  See "help configshow" for a discussion of templates.
This option will only work if a list, domain, or site master
password is used.  When a configuration template is displayed,
the text of "comments" setting of that template is presented
as a description of the template.

If the owner of a mailing list types the name of her list as a 
pattern, and uses the master password for the list, the lists
command may display extra information.  In "aux" mode, auxiliary
lists which are not included in the sublists setting are displayed.
In "config" mode, configuration templates for her list and the
DEFAULT list are shown.
