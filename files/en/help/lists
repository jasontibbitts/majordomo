The lists command shows some or all of the public mailing lists 
hosted at $DOMAIN.

To see a description of every public list, simply use this command:

  lists

You can also use a pattern to search the list of lists, for example:

  lists major

would display all mailing lists with "major" in their names.
(See "help patterns" for more information on search patterns).

Command modes
-------------

Anyone using the lists command can take advantage of the following
command modes.  Command modes can be combined by joining them with
hyphens or equal signs (e.g., "lists-enhanced-long" or "lists=full=short")

  compact
    A long description of each list is provided, and lists are grouped by
    category.

  enhanced
    The lists to which you are subscribed are marked.

  full
    Extra details are shown for each list:  the number of subscribers,
    the digests delivered, the number of posted messages in the last 30
    days, and other information.

  long
    A long description of each list is provided, and lists are grouped by
    category.  A count of lists is shown.

  short 
    A brief description of each list is provided, and lists are grouped by 
    category.  A count of lists is shown.

  tiny
    Only the list names are displayed.  The list descriptions and categories 
    are omitted.

To find out where you are subscribed without descriptive paragraphs, use
this command:

  lists-enhanced-short

This command will create a lengthy report about all of the lists:

  lists-long-full


Command modes for list administrators
-------------------------------------

  aux
    If an administrative password is used, all auxiliary lists will
    be displayed.  Otherwise, only the public auxiliary lists (from
    the "sublists" configuration setting) will be displayed.
    See "help auxiliary_list" for an introduction to sublists.

  config
    All configuration templates for a list will be displayed.
    See "help configshow" for a discussion of templates.
    This option will only work if an administrative password is used.
    When a configuration template is displayed, the text of the "comments" 
    setting of that template is presented as a description of the template.

To see a summary of all public configuration templates, use this command:

  lists-config DEFAULT

If the owner of a mailing list types the name of her list as a pattern, 
and uses the master password for the list, the lists command may display 
extra information.  In "aux" mode, auxiliary lists which are not included 
in the sublists setting are displayed.  In "config" mode, configuration 
templates for her list and the DEFAULT list are shown.

When an administrative password is not used with the lists command,
the following steps are taken to determine if a list should be shown
to the person who make the request:

  * If the person is subscribed to the list, and the GLOBAL 
    advertise_subscribed setting is turned on, the list is shown.

  * Any rules for the "advertise" request in the list's access_rules setting
    are considered.

  * If the person's address matches any of the patterns in the list's
    noadvertise configuration setting, the list is not shown.

  * If the list's advertise configuration setting contains patterns,
    and the person's address does not match at least one of them,
    the list is not shown.

  * If none of the first four rules is applicable, the list is shown.
