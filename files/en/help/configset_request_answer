$INCLUDE-config/request_answer

The effects of this setting will vary according to its value:

majordomo
---------
Commands in the body of the message will be processed as if they were
sent to the server address, $MJ.  When commands are sent to a "request"
address, Majordomo will attempt to insert the list name into a command
if it is not already present.

A similar effect can be produced by using the "default list" command.
See "help default" for details.

owner
-----
The message will be sent to the addresses in the owners configuration
setting.

response
--------
The request_response document can be customized on a list-by-list basis.
See "help admin_documents" for more details.  The stock document gives
basic instructions for using the subscribe and unsubscribe commands to
join or leave the mailing list.

Access to this document can be restricted using rules for the
"request_response" command in the access_rules setting.  
See "help configset_access_rules" for more details.

The headers from the GLOBAL message_headers setting will be added to the 
response message, to reduce the likelihood of mail loops.
