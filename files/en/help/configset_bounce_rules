Jason is working on adding bounce_rules and thus completing the basic
bounce handling feature set. In CVS, the variable and its parser are
there but it is not acted upon.  This will probably change tonight or
tomorrow as he puts in the rest of the code.

Currently bounce_rules is very simple. It has a syntax much like access_rules,
but without the first line specifying the request list, so each rule is just a
line with actions and several lines of conditionals; a blank line separates rules.

Currently there are two actions:
  unsubscribe - removes the user [1]
  ignore      - does nothing

The owner is still sent the bounce notice as before.  The variables
currently recognized [2] are:
  days_since_subscribe
  consecutive - number of consecutive messages bounced
  day         - number of bounces in the last 24 hours
  week        - number of bounces in the last 7 days
  month       - number of bounces in the last 30 days
  bouncedpct  - percentage of bounced messages calculated from the lowest
                and highest bounced messages and the count of numbered
                bounced messages: (highest - lowest +1) / count

Obviously we will want some way to control what bounce notices the list
owner sees.  I think there are two ways to go; we can keep bounce_rules
simple and use other variables to control what the owner sees or we can add
additional actions to bounce_rules and give the owner lots of freedom about
when to be notified.  I'm not really sure which is the way to go.  I'd like
to avoid a mixed approach (where you can do things with the rules and with
the variables).

1] This will eventually include a final probe message that must bounce for
   the removal to take effect.

2] I recall that there was some question as to the validity of these
   statistics while I was away.  I think it revolved around not correlating
   "bounces per day/week/month" with messages passing through the list
   during that time.  I counter that this is the best that we can do, since
   the bounces can be received an arbitrary amount of time (I've seen four
   weeks) after the message is sent.  The point is to build up an accurate
   picture of what list messages are bouncing without trying to do any
   correlation with list messages.  Not that it can't be done, but that it
   can't be done "simply".  Sure, we could look up the date of the message
   in the archive and compute a "bounce delay time", but that doesn't
   qualify as "simple".
