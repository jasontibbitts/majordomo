Currently there are three basic actions; inform is the default:
  ignore - do nothing; do not send a bounce notice to the owners and
           perform no action on the list of subscribers.
  inform - send a bounce notice to the owners, but leave the bouncing user
           on the list.
  remove - send a bounce notice to the owners, and remove the user from the
           list.

There are several modes for the remove action.  By default, the list owners
are sent a notice of the bounce (as with the inform action) and the
bouncing user is sent one final, unique test message and if it bounces then
the user is removed.

The remove-consult action will, after the test message has bounced, send a
consultation token to the list owners instead of immediately removing the
user.  If this token is accepted, then the user is removed.

The remove-noprobe action will immediately remove the user, without sending
the probing test message to verify that the user is indeed bouncing.

The remove-noprobe-consult action is also valid; it causes the owners to be
consulted but no probing test message to be sent to the bouncing user.

Finally, the -quiet mode (i.e. remove-consult-quiet, remove-noprobe-quiet,
remove-noprobe-consult-quiet) suppresses the bounce notice that is sent.
The owners will still see a consultation token if one was requested, and
will still receive notice that the bouncing user has been unsubscribed from
the list if that happens.

The bounce message is sent to the e-mail addresses in the bounce_recipients
configuration setting, or to the list owners if that setting is empty.  

The variables currently recognized are:
  days_since_subscribe
  consecutive - number of consecutive messages bounced
  day         - number of bounces in the last 24 hours
  week        - number of bounces in the last 7 days
  month       - number of bounces in the last 30 days
  bouncedpct  - percentage of bounced messages calculated from the lowest
                and highest bounced messages and the count of numbered
                bounced messages: (highest - lowest +1) / count

Obviously we will want some way to control what bounce notices the list
owner sees.  I think there are two ways to go; we can keep bounce_rules
simple and use other variables to control what the owner sees or we can add
additional actions to bounce_rules and give the owner lots of freedom about
when to be notified.  I'm not really sure which is the way to go.  I'd like
to avoid a mixed approach (where you can do things with the rules and with
the variables).

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
