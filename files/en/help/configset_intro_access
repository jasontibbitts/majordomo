EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL intro_access = open


One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members access, while closed completely
disables the command for everyone.  INTRO files are accessed either with
'intro' or with 'get'.

This functionality of this variable is completely encapsulated within
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists because it's simpler to use.
