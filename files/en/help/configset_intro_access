EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL intro_access = open


One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members to get "intro" files associated with
the named list or GLOBAL pseudo-list, while closed completely disables the
"intro" command for everyone. The "get" command can be used for files which
are also available via "faq", "intro", etc., depending on how your file
system is configured, and get_access does NOT restrict use of those other
ways to retrieve special files.

This functionality of this variable is completely encapsulated within
the access_rules mechanism, but it exists because it's simpler to use.
