EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/intro_access

This setting determines who can use the intro command to retrieve
the introductory document for a list.  The intro document normally
resides in a list's private file space, and therefore can also be
accessed by the get and index commands, but only by list administrators.

If an intro document does not exist for the list, the intro command
will cause a default document to be retrieved from the DEFAULT or
GLOBAL pseudo-list, or from the stock files supplied by Majordomo.

An administrative password can be used to issue the intro command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the intro command  
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
