address,  if specified, is an email address current subscribed to listname
listname, required, is the name of a list at this site
-pattern, if specified, treats the address as a pattern (see "help patterns")
-allmatching, if specified, operates on every address that matches
-farewell,   if specified, sends a "farewell" message to each address.

By default, the "unsubscribe" command removes an "address" from the
named list. Unless the command is "approve"d in advance, a confirmation
token may be sent to the given "address" (based on unsubscribe_policy
or the access_rules settings for "listname") to verify this action,
and must be replied to with an "accept" command before the address is
removed from the list.

To unsubscribe from the LISTNAME mailing list at this site,
as simply as possible, send this one-line message to $MJ:
    unsubscribe LISTNAME 
replacing "LISTNAME" with the name of the list.

If the address you wish to remove from the list is different from
the address from which you are sending the message, the command
may be written instead as:
    unsubscribe LISTNAME EmailAddress
replacing "EmailAddress" with the address you want to remove from
the list.

A message may be sent to each address being removed acknowledging
the removal of the subscription.  This "farewell" message will only
be sent if the "-farewell" option is used.  

The unregister command will automatically remove an address from all lists at
this site, or the unsubscribe command can be used to selectively remove
an address from one list at a time.  Even after the address has been
unsubscribed from all lists one at a time, it will still exist in the
registration database unless "unregister" is used. 

Without the "-pattern" option, "address" is matched literally with
no interpretation of special characters. Matching is case sensitive.

If the "-pattern" option is used, "address" is interpreted as a
Majordomo matching pattern. Review the "help patterns" file carefully.
Patterns can be very simple or full-blown Perl regular expressions.
When -pattern is used to unsubscribe addresses with wild cards, the
list password is required and confirmations will not be requested.
Without "-allmatching", only the first matching address is removed.

If the "-allmatching" option is used with "-pattern", then every
address that matches the pattern will be removed from the list.

Each address has an original and a canonical form.  Usually these
addresses are the same, but if the original address (the one
that was used to subscribe to a mailing list) is an alias for
another address, the latter address is the canonical address.

When the "-pattern" option is used, the canonical addresses are 
compared to the pattern.  This may cause some surprising results
when an original address that does not match the pattern is
reported to have been unsubscribed.

The "-pattern" option always requires the list password, and does not
apply patterns to list names.  The "-regex" option is identical 
to the "-pattern" option.

List owners can unsubscribe more than one address or pattern from a 
mailing list using a "here document" or "here file" (see "help commands" 
for a description of here files.)  For example, to remove the
addresses a@example.com and b@example.com from a list, the owner
could use the following command:

unsubscribe-farewell LISTNAME <<ABC
a@example.com
b@example.com
ABC

List owners can also remove addresses from a collection called an "auxiliary
subscriber list" (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details.)  The
farewell command mode works with auxiliary lists, but only if the address
in question is registered in this domain (see "help register" for more
information about the Majordomo registry).

   help password    (which changes an individual's password)
   help patterns    (for simple and complex regular expressions)
   help register    (which adds an address to the Majordomo registry)
   help subscribe   (which adds an address to a list)
   help unregister  (which removes an address from all lists)
