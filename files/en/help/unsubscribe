The unsubscribe command will remove one or more addresses from a 
mailing list.

The simplest way to remove your address from a mailing list is
to send the following command in the body of an e-mail message to
$MJ:
  unsubscribe LISTNAME 
Replace "LISTNAME" with the name of the list you wish to leave.

If the address you wish to remove from the list is different from
the address from which you are sending the message, the command
may be written instead as:
  unsubscribe LISTNAME ADDRESS
Replace "ADDRESS" with the e-mail address you want to remove from
the list.  A confirmation message may be sent to that address or to
the list administrators.

When your address is removed from a mailing list with the unsubscribe
command, your address will remain in Majordomo's registration database
unless you use the unregister command to remove it.  As long as your
address is registered, you can continue to use your personal password
to join mailing lists.  See "help unregister" and "help password" for
more details.

If you wish to change your address, you can use the changeaddr command
instead of unsubscribing your old address and subscribing your new
address separately.  See "help changeaddr" for more details.

If you wish to stop receiving mail temporarily, you can change all of 
your subscriptions to "nomail" mode with the following command:
  set ALL nomail

When you are ready to start receiving mail again, use the following
command:
  set ALL nomail-return
See "help set" for more details.


                    The unsubscribe-farewell command

The "farewell" command mode can be used to send a "farewell" message to
each address that is removed from the list.  The farewell message
contains the personal password for that address and instructions for
resubscribing or unregistering.


                     Notes for list administrators

Patterns
--------
If the "pattern" command mode is used, you must specify a pattern on the
command line.  See "help patterns" for an introduction Majordomo
matching pattern.  An administrative password is required to use the
"pattern" mode.  The "regex" mode is identical to the "pattern" mode.

If the "allmatching" command mode is also used, every address that
matches the pattern will be removed from the list.  Otherwise, only the
first address that matches the pattern will be removed.


Pattern examples
----------------
The following command will remove the first address that matches
"example.net" from the LISTNAME mailing list:

  unsubscribe-pattern LISTNAME example.net


The following command will remove every address that matches
"example.edu" from the LISTNAME mailing list:

  unsubscribe-pattern-allmatching LISTNAME example.edu


The following command will remove all of the subscribers from the
LISTNAME mailing list:

  unsubscribe-pattern-allmatching LISTNAME ALL


Canonical Addresses
-------------------
Each address has an original and a canonical form.  Usually these
addresses are the same, but if the original address (the one that was
used to subscribe to a mailing list) is an alias for another address,
the latter address is the canonical address.

When the "pattern" mode is used, the canonical addresses are compared to
the pattern.  This may cause some surprising results when an original
address that does not match the pattern is reported to have been
unsubscribed.


Here documents
--------------
List owners can unsubscribe more than one address or pattern from a 
mailing list using a "here document" or "here file" (see "help commands" 
for a description of here files.)  For example, to remove the
addresses a@example.com and b@example.com from a list, the owner
could use the following command:

unsubscribe-farewell LISTNAME <<ABC
a@example.com
b@example.com
ABC


Auxiliary lists
---------------
List owners can also remove addresses from a collection called an
"auxiliary list" (see "help auxiliary_list" for more details.)  The
farewell command mode works with auxiliary lists, but only if the
address in question is registered in this domain (see "help register"
for more information about the Majordomo registry).

It is only possible to unsubscribe an invalid address using the
"pattern" or "regex" command mode.  Subscribers' addresses can become
invalid, for example, if the GLOBAL configuration settings that affect
the validity of e-mail addresses are made stricter.
