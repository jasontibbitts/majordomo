address,    required, is an email address not previously subscribed
listname,   required, is the name of a list at this site
-regexp, if specified, makes address a pattern (see "help patterns")
-allmatching, if specified, operates on every address that matches

By default, the "unsubscribe" command removes an "address" from the
named list. Unless the command is "approve"d in advance, a confirmation
token will be sent to the given "address" to verify this action, and
must be replied to with an "accept" command before the address is
removed from the list.

To unsubscribe from the LISTNAME email broadcast list at this site,
as simply as possible, send this one-line message to $MJ:
    unsubscribe LISTNAME YourEmailAddress
replacing "LISTNAME" with the name of the list and replacing
"YourEmailAddress" with the address that was subscribed to the
list. Additional commands may be required, but you will receive
messages telling you what to do if necessary.

Unregistering will automatically remove an address from all lists at
this site, or the unsubscribe command can be used to selectively remove
an address from one list at a time. Even after the address has been
unsubscribed from all lists one at a time, it will still exist in the
registration database unless "unregister" is used. This allows a user
to leave one list and join another without obtaining a new password.

It is possible to register, get a password, and then use "approve"
to unsubscribe to several lists instead of using "accept" to confirm
each unsubscribe. List owners and site administrators with list
passwords can also pre-approve unsubscribe to bypass "accept".

Without the "-regexp" option, "address" is matched literally with
no interpretation of special characters. Matching is case sensitive.

If the "-regexp" option is used, "address" is interpreted as a
Majordomo matching pattern. Review the "help patterns" file carefully.
Patterns can be very simple or full-blown Perl regular expressions.

If the "-allmatching" option is used with "-regexp", then every
address that matches the pattern will be removed from the list.
Without "-allmatching", only the first matching address is removed.

See Also:
   help approve     (which can eliminate the need to use "accept")
   help changeaddr  (which replaces one address with another)
   help password    (which changes an individual's password)
   help patterns    (for simple and complex regular expressions)
   help subscribe   (which adds an address to a list)
   help unregister  (which removes an address from all lists)
