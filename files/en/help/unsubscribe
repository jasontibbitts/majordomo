address,    required, is an email address not previously subscribed
listname,   required, is the name of a list at this site
-regexp, if specified, makes address a pattern (see "help patterns")
-allmatching, if specified, operates on every address that matches

By default, the "unsubscribe" command removes an "address" from the
named list. Unless the command is "approve"d in advance, a confirmation
token may be sent to the given "address" (based on unsubscribe_policy
or the access_rules settings for "listname") to verify this action,
and must be replied to with an "accept" command before the address is
removed from the list.

To unsubscribe from the LISTNAME email broadcast list at this site,
as simply as possible, send this one-line message to $MJ:
    unsubscribe LISTNAME YourEmailAddress
replacing "LISTNAME" with the name of the list and replacing
"YourEmailAddress" with the address that was subscribed to the
list. Additional commands may be required, but you will receive
messages telling you what to do if necessary.

Unregistering will automatically remove an address from all lists at
this site, or the unsubscribe command can be used to selectively remove
an address from one list at a time. Even after the address has been
unsubscribed from all lists one at a time, it will still exist in the
registration database unless "unregister" is used. This allows a user
to leave one list and join another without obtaining a new password.

If you want to put multiple unsubscribe commands in a single message
to the server, it is possible to get a password (if you don't already
have one or don't remember it), and then use "approve" to unsubscribe
from several lists instead of using "accept" to confirm each unsubscribe.
(The "-regexp" option always requires the list password, and does not
apply patterns to list names.) List owners and site administrators
with list passwords can also pre-approve unsubscribe to bypass "accept"
for basic unsub commands.

Without the "-regexp" option, "address" is matched literally with
no interpretation of special characters. Matching is case sensitive.

If the "-regexp" option is used, "address" is interpreted as a
Majordomo matching pattern. Review the "help patterns" file carefully.
Patterns can be very simple or full-blown Perl regular expressions.
When -regexp is used to unsubscribe addresses with wild cards, the
list password is required and confirmations will not be requested.
Without "-allmatching", only the first matching address is removed.

If the "-allmatching" option is used with "-regexp", then every
address that matches the pattern will be removed from the list.
