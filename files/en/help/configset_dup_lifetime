EXAMPLE:
configset listname dup_lifetime = 28


The number of days that entries in the duplicate databases will be
kept.  Majordomo saves information about Message-ID:s and various
checksums of messages that pass through the list in order to filter
out duplicates.  To limit database size and to cut down on the
possibility of false positives, these entries are periodically
trimmed after this number of days.

When a message is delivered to a regular list, checksums from OTHER
posts to that same lists are compared to see if the same post has
already been distributed. The access_rules configuration determines
whether duplicate posts are denied, sent to the list owner for
approval, or sent out anyway.

Also when a message is delivered, the GLOBAL dup_lifetime setting
is checked.  If it is zero, no thinning of duplicates is done
for the entire domain. Duplicates are not checked across domains.
If a message with the same message ID or full checksum has been
seen on a DIFFERENT LIST, the lists on which it was delivered are
checked for addresses that are on the list currently being checked
and those addresses are not sent copies by the current list. Duplicate
checking can be avoided on a list-by-list basis by excluding the
"unique" class from the list of allowed classes. Duplicate checking
across lists has no influence on the content of digests. For more
information on duplicates, refer to the "unique" class in "help set".

Currently, this lifetime is also used to determine how long post data
is kept around for post limiting. See "help configset post_limits".
