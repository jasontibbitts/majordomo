EXAMPLE:
configset listname dup_lifetime = 28


The number of days that entries in the duplicate databases will be
kept.  Majordomo saves information about Message-ID:s and various
checksums of messages that pass through the list in order to filter
out duplicates.  To limit database size and to cut down on the
possibility of false positives, these entries are periodically
trimmed after this number of days.

Currently, this lifetime is also used to determine how long post data
is kept around for post limiting. See "help configset post_limits".
