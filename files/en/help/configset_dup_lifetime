# dup_lifetime
# (28)                 [integer] <resend,majordomo>
# The number of days that entries in the duplicate databases will be
# kept.  Majordomo saves information about Message-ID:s and various
# checksums of messages that pass through the list in order to filter
# out duplicates.  To limit database size and to cut down on the
# possibility of false positives, these entries are periodically
# trimmed after this number of days.
