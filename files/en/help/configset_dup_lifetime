$INCLUDE-config/dup_lifetime

Majordomo saves the contents of the Message-ID header and two checksums
of each posted message that is sent to a mailing list, in order to filter
out duplicates.  The "full" checksum represents the contents of the
entire body of a posted message.  The "partial" checksum represents the
contents of the first 10 lines of the first message body part.  By
default, if a posted message has an ID or checksum that duplicates a
previous message, the new message will be held for moderation.

To limit database size and to cut down on the possibility of false
positives, old entries are removed periodically.  The frequency with
which the old entries are removed is determined by the "checksum"
trigger in the "triggers" configuration setting.  By default, this
happens daily.

By default, IDs and checksums are saved for all messages which are
posted to a mailing list, even if those messages are rejected by the
moderators or denied by the access rules.  If the
"save_denial_checksums" setting is turned off, the checksums of denied
messages will not be saved.

Four access variables (dup, dup_checksum, dup_msg_id, and
dup_partial_checksum) can be used to adjust what happens to a duplicate
message or to turn off one or more of the duplicate checks.  
See "help configset_access_rules" and "help access_variables" for more
information about access variables.


             Domain-wide duplicates and the "unique" class

Normally, when a message is delivered to the subscribers of a mailing
list, subscribers with the "unique" delivery class will not receive a
copy of the message if its checksums or ID match a previously delivered
message.  See "help set" for a more complete explanation of the "unique"
class.

If the GLOBAL dup_lifetime setting has a value of zero, duplicate
checking for the "unique" class will be disabled for every mailing list
in the domain.  In this case, subscribers in the "unique" class will
receive each message that is delivered to a mailing list.  Domain-wide
duplicate checking can be avoided on a list-by-list basis by excluding
the "unique" class from the allowed_classes configuration setting. 

Domain-wide duplicate checking across lists has no influence on the
content of digests.


                          Database file names

Database files are kept in the main directory of each mailing list.  
Depending upon the database back end in use, the files will be named
  _dup_id_.D, _dup_partial.D, and _dup_sum.D
or
  _dup_id_.T, _dup_partial.T, and _dup_sum.T
