The intro command displays an introductory file for a mailing list, if one
exists. 

In recent editions of Majordomo version 1, the "intro" document is
sent in the welcome message that new subscribers receive when they
join a mailing list.  Majordomo 2, by default, will send the "info"
document instead.  As a result, the intro document is not normally used,
and this command is supported only for purposes of compatibility.

The welcome_files configuration setting can be adjusted to use the
"intro" file in the welcome message, if the list owners prefer.
