The intro command displays an introductory file for a mailing list, if one
exists. 

In recent editions of Majordomo version 1, the "intro" document is
sent in the welcome message that new subscribers receive when they
join a mailing list.  Majordomo 2, by default, will send the "info"
document instead.  As a result, the intro document is not normally used,
and this command is supported only for purposes of compatibility.

The welcome_files configuration setting can be adjusted to use the
"intro" file in the welcome message, if the list owners prefer.

The intro document supports variable substitutions (see "help variables" 
for more details).  

The "edit" command mode is designed to allow list owners
to edit and replace the existing document easily.  For example,
the command:
  intro-edit test-list

would display the contents of the intro document wrapped in a "newintro"
command:

newintro test-list <<ADGBEH

The test-list is open to anyone interested in the new Majordomo
server at \$SITE.  However, the list is lightly 
moderated for civility.  If you have questions about the moderation
policy, please write to \$OWNER.

ADGBEH

Please see "help here_document" and "help newintro" for more information
on replacing the intro document.
