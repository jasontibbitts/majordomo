EXAMPLE:
configset listname bounce_max_count = 20


The maximum number of bounce data kept for a user.

The bounce_max_count and bounce_max_age settings are just used for
expiring old bounce data; we don't want to keep too much of it around
and so we delete a bounce datum if it is too old or we have too many
(in which case, the oldest are tossed).
