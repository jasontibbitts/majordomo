The newinfo command will replace the contents of the "/info" file
that is displayed by the info command.  By default, this file is also 
sent to new subscribers when they join a mailing list (see
"help configset_welcome_files" for more details).

The new contents of the info file must be included in a here document
(see "help here_document" for more details).  For example, the
following command would replace the contents of the info file with
the sentence "Hello, subscriber!":

newinfo LISTNAME <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

The newinfo command is a convenient way to use the put command.  For
example, the following use of the put command is identical to the
newinfo command in the previous example.

put LISTNAME /info List Information <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

By default, an administrative password is required to use the newinfo
command.  The access restrictions for the put command (as determined
by the access_rules configuration setting) also apply to the newinfo
command.
