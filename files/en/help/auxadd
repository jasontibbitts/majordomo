The command "auxsubscribe" is identical to "auxadd".

Adds an address to the named sublist of a given list. The sublist,
also known as an auxiliary list, will be created automatically if
it doesn't exist already. Do NOT use createlist to create sublists!

Using auxadd does not add an address to the list of subscribers.
People who wish to receive messages that are posted to the list
must use the "subscribe" command.
 
Sublists are used by list owners to classify e-mail addresses into
categories.  For example, if you manage a restricted list, you
might decide to allow people who always write high-quality messages
to post messages without your approval.  First, create an access rule
for your list:

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
post
allow
@goodguys
ENDTAG

This access rule says, "Always allow people in the 'goodguys' sublist
to post messages to the list."  

Next, use the auxadd command to permit someone to post messages without
your intervention:

auxadd YOUR_LIST goodguys heroine@example.net

It is possible to use sublists of other mailing lists in your list's 
access rules.  For example, if you wanted to allow addresses from
the "heroes" sublist of the "testlist" list to post messages to
your list, the access rule would be written like this:

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
post
allow
@testlist:heroes
ENDTAG

A colon is used to separate the name of the other list from the 
name of the sublist.
