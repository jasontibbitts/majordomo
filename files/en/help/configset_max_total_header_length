EXAMPLE:
configset listname max_total_header_length = 2048


Sets the maximum length of the combined headers in an unapproved
message in number of characters. Set to zero to disable the total
header length check, use configset max_header_line_length to check
individual header lines one at a time. Actual header size and a
boolean for exceeding this limit can be tested in access_rules.
