This is a backwards compatibility command.  Under Mj1, you called
  mkdigest listname password
at intervals to push out digests.

In Mj2, mkdigest just gets turned into 
  approve password digest-force listname
which causes all digests to be pushed for the named list.

You must have list archives enabled to create digests.

   help digest  (for another way to force digests)
