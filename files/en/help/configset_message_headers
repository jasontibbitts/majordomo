These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.  They will not replace any
existing headers.  However, it is possible to use the delete_headers
setting or purge_received setting in combination with the 
message_headers setting if you wish to replace certain headers
in posted messages.

A "Reply-To" header is required for the GLOBAL pseudo-list to 
function properly.  Do not delete it if you change this setting.
Majordomo will normally put
  $MJOWNER 
in the "From" header, and 
  $MJ
in the "Reply-To" header to prevent mail loops between servers.
The "Reply-To" header allows people to respond to the server more
easily.

There are header traps in place:  see "help configset_block_headers"
for a description of headers which will cause Majordomo to reject 
a message without examining it for commands.  Using the GLOBAL 
block_headers and message_headers settings in tandem can reduce 
the likelihood of mail loops.

Whenever a posted message is approved by the moderators using the 
accept command, it is re-mailed to the list address with an Approved: 
header included.  This causes the message to be delivered immediately
without undergoing any access checks.  Any existing Delivered-To headers 
are removed from the message to reduce the chance of a bounce.

For regular lists, there are other settings that can be used to change
the headers of a message.  See "help configset_reply_to",
"help configset_sender", "help configset_precedence", and 
"help configset_subject_prefix"  for additional information. 

The text of each added header will undergo variable substitution as it
is added to the message.   The variables supported include the standard
substitutions, plus DATE, HOST, MSGNO, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT,
SUBSCRIBED, and USER.  See "help variables" for more information.

Any headers with leading spaces, with control characters or spaces in
their names, or without a colon (':') will be ignored.
