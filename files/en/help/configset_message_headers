These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.

WARNING: A "Reply-To" header is REQUIRED for the GLOBAL pseudo-list
to function properly. Make sure you don't delete it if you replace
the defaults! This will be the address that confirmation tokens
(for commands like subscribe and set) go to with a default reply,
and without it confirmations may go to the list owner, depending
on the values in "configset sender", and "configset whoami".

There are header traps in place: See "help configset block_headers"
for a description of headers which are both added and looked for.
(Specifically, X-Loop has special meaning!) List owners are encouraged
to add an X-Loop header to outgoing posts, using "configset message_headers",
as an additional safety precaution. This is a good place to include
an evaluated variable for the list name (so filters can always figure
out which list the post came from) and perhaps a sequence number.

Whenever a post is accepted, it is re-mailed to the list 
address with an Approved: header included.  Any existing
Delivered-To headers are removed to reduce the chance of a bounce.

For regular lists, there are other header fields that can be added
with different variables available. See "help configset reply_to"
and "help configset sender" for additional information. You normally
don't need to control list replies with "configset message_headers".

This header text will undergo variable substitution as it is added
to the message. See "help variables" for a list of substitutions
which are supported.
