These headers will be appended to the headers of a posted message
when a regular list is specified, or to the headers of replies
from the server (such as token confirmation requests) when the
GLOBAL pseudo-list is specified.

WARNING: A "Reply-to" header is required for the GLOBAL pseudo-list
to function properly. Make sure you don't delete it if you replace
the defaults! This will be the address that confirmation tokens
(for commands like subscribe and set) go to with a default reply,
and without it confirmations may go to the list owner, depending
on the values in the sender and whoami configuration settings.

There are header traps in place: See "help configset_block_headers"
for a description of headers which will cause Majordomo to 
reject a message without examining it for commands.

Whenever a posted message is approved by the moderators using the 
accept command, it is re-mailed to the list address with an Approved: 
header included.  This causes the message to be delivered immediately
without undergoing any access checks.  Any existing Delivered-To headers 
are removed from the message to reduce the chance of a bounce.

For regular lists, there are other header fields that can be added or changed
using different configuration settings. See "help configset_reply_to",
"help configset_sender", "help configset_precedence", and 
"help configset_subject_prefix"  for additional information. You normally
will not need to control your mailing list's reply address with the
message_headers setting.

This header text will undergo variable substitution as it is added
to the message.   The variables supported include the standard substitutions,
plus ARCHIVE, ARCURL, DATE, SENDER, SEQNO, SUBJECT, SUBSCRIBED, and USER.
See "help variables" for more information.
