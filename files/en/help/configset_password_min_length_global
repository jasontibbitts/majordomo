(extracted on 7 Mar 1999 from configshow-comments, default value is below)

# password_min_length
# (4)                  [integer] <password>
# This sets the minimum length for user passwords.  This takes effect
# when a user is setting their password; passwords generated randomly
# will always be six characters long (currently).  There is no maximum
# password length, but for security reasons it is wise to enforce a
# lower limit.
configset GLOBAL password_min_length = 6
