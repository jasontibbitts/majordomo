The faq command returns a Frequently Asked Questions file for a mailing
list, if one exists.

The faq document supports variable substitutions (see "help variables" 
for more details).  

The "edit" command mode is designed to allow list owners
to edit and replace the existing document easily.  For example,
the command:
  faq-edit test-list

would display the contents of the faq document wrapped in a "newfaq"
command:

newfaq test-list <<ADGBEH

Q.:  How do I leave the test-list?

A.:  Send a message to \$MJ.  
     In the body of the message, put this command:
       unsub test-list

ADGBEH

Please see "help here_document" and "help newfaq" for more information
on replacing the faq document.
