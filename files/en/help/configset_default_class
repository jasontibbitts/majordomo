EXAMPLE:
configset listname default_class = digest


$INCLUDE-config/default_class

The default class is usually a single word (digest, each, nomail, or
unique).  If you choose the "digest" default class, new subscribers will
be placed in the default digest by default.  The default digest is the
digest that appears first in the digests configuration setting.  If you
wish to use another digest, add a dash and its name to the word
"digest".   For example, to make the "weekly" digest the default class,
use the following command:

  configset LISTNAME default_class = digest-weekly

The value that you supply is not validated.  If you choose a default
class that is not supported, the "each" class will be used instead.

The default_class only affects subscriptions that do not mention the
class explicitly.  For example, if someone uses the following command to
subscribe to a mailing list:

  subscribe-set LISTNAME nomail

the new subscription will have the "nomail" delivery class, regardless
of the value of the default_class setting.
