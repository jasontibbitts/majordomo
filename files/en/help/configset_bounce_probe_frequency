Probing allows Majordomo to determine more easily which subscribers are
not receiving mail from a mailing list.  When a subscriber's address is
probed, a posted message or digest is sent to that address in a way that
uniquely identifies the recipient.

Setting this value to zero disables regular bounce probing.  Setting
this value to one would cause every address to be probed for every
message, which can consume more computer resources and make delivery
very slow.

This setting will be ignored if the MTA is qmail, because qmail does an
equivalent kind of bounce probing automatically.

To probe the entire subscriber list an average of once per day, choose
a value that is equal to the average number of posted messages your list
receives in a day.

Any subscriber's address that has experienced delivery failures recently
will be probed automatically.
