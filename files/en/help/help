     Majordomo2 - Basic Help File - updated 3 Mar 99
(more detailed help is available on many topics: see below)

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe and
unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list archives.
You are using version $VERSION of Majordomo2

This help message is from the Majordomo list management system at
     $SITE
You interact with the Majordomo software by sending commands to
     $MJ
in the body of a mail message. Please do not put your commands in
the subject! Majordomo only processes commands in the message body.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself, and remember that all commands
are case sensitive: don't replace lower case characters with upper
case, and vice versa. If you put the command "end" (without quotes)
in your message, Majordomo will stop reading commands at that line.
The "end" command is only required if you use a "signature block" at
the end of your mail, or if your mail program appends additional text
to your mail, because Majordomo may mistakenly believe that these
additional lines are commands and you may get strange error messages.

Additional information is available from this server in the form of
help topics. You are reading the basic help file now, obtained by just
sending "help" to the server. For other topics, send one or more of the
commands below to $MJ
   help user overview
   help user commands
   help admin overview
   help admin commands
(other help files are available, including details of every command
you can send to the server, and those files are listed in the ones
that are mentioned here)

For another copy of this message, send:
   help help

To get a complete list of ALL available topics, send:
   help topics

To find out what you, as a list subscriber, can do with Majordomo
(finding out about lists, subscribing, unsubscribing, getting files
from the server, confirmations, passwords, etc.) send:
   help user overview

For a complete subscriber (or end-user) command reference, send:
   help user commands

To find out what you, as a list owner, can do with Majordomo
(altering list configurations, subscribing and unsubscribing
other people, storing files, approving posts, etc.) send:
   help admin overview

For a complete list administrator command reference, send:
   help admin commands

To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to the "-owner"
address which exists for every list. For example, to contact the
owner of the hypothetical list
    some-list@$WHEREAMI
you would send mail to:
    some-list-owner@$WHEREAMI

To contact a human site manager, send mail to $MJOWNER

NOTE: A major design goal of Majordomo 2 is to provide something that looks
exactly like Majordomo 1.94.4 to the users.  All existing instructions for
end users of Majordomo-managed lists should still be applicable, excepting
places where changes in previous behavior were required to fix bugs or plug
security holes.  (Note that the changes in the confirmation process both
fix bugs and improve security and also make things much easier on users.)
The situation is much the same for list owners, but the approval and config
procedures have changed.  There is some backwards compatibility here,
though, and more may be forthcoming.  There are, of course, many more
variables that can be set.

For a list of topics, or this text, send one of the next two lines
   help topics
   help help
to the server at $MJ
