(More detailed help is available on many topics, including details
of every command you can send to the server: refer to "help topics".)

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe and
unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list archives.
This is version $VERSION of Majordomo2

This help message is from the Majordomo list management system at
     $SITE
You interact with the Majordomo software by sending commands to
     $MJ
in the body of a mail message. Please do not put your commands in
the subject! Majordomo only processes commands in the message body.

You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
Put each command on a line by itself, and remember that commands
are NOT case sensitive: you can replace lower case characters with
upper case, and vice versa. Some commands also have abbreviations
and alternate command names, like "subscribe" (for which "sub" works)
and "unsubscribe" (for which "unsub" and "signoff" both work).

If you put the command "end" (without quotes) in your message,
Majordomo will stop reading commands at that line (see "help end").
Your site administrator may also configure Majordomo to stop reading
commands at commonly used signature block separator lines.

To subscribe or unsubscribe from the LISTNAME email broadcast list
at this site, send a one-line message to $MJ:
    subscribe LISTNAME YourEmailAddress
or
    unsubscribe LISTNAME YourEmailAddress
replacing "LISTNAME" with the name of the list and replacing
"YourEmailAddress" with the address you want to add to or remove
from the list. Additional commands may be required, but you will
receive messages telling you what to do if necessary.

Additional information is available from this server in the form of
help topics. You are reading the basic help file now, obtained by just
sending "help" to the server. For other topics, send one or more of the
commands described below to $MJ

To find out what you, as a list subscriber, can do with Majordomo
(finding out about lists, subscribing, unsubscribing, getting files
from the server, confirmations, passwords, etc.) send:
   help overview

For a complete subscriber (or end-user) command reference, send:
   help commands

If you are the owner or moderator of a mailing list, you will want
to use one or both of the following commands to get information about
the special Majordomo commands for mailing list administration:
   help admin
   help admin commands

To retrieve a new copy of this help file, send the command:
   help help

To retrieve a complete list of ALL available topics, send:
   help topics

To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to the "-owner"
address which exists for every list. For example, to contact the
owner of the hypothetical list
    some-list@$WHEREAMI
you would send mail to:
    some-list-owner@$WHEREAMI

To contact a human site manager, send mail to $MJOWNER

A Note to Longtime Majordomo Users: Majordomo 2.0 tries as hard as
possible to be backwards-compatible with previous versions of Majordomo.
All user commands and many admin commands from previous versions should
work; those that don't will provide you with a pointer to their replacements.

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
