Majordomo 2 is computer software that automates the distribution of
electronic mail messages on mailing lists.  The majordomo help system 
has many documents that will help you understand how Majordomo 2 works.  
All of these documents can be retrieved using the help command.

To find out what you, as a list subscriber, can do with Majordomo
(finding out about lists, subscribing, unsubscribing, getting files
from the server, confirmations, passwords, etc.) use this command:
   help overview

For a complete subscriber (or end-user) command reference, send:
   help commands

If you are the owner or moderator of a mailing list, you will want
to use one or both of the following commands to get information about
the special Majordomo commands for mailing list administration:
   help admin
   help admin_commands

There are two shortcuts available in the help system to make typing topic 
names a little easier.  The first is that anywhere an underscore, _, 
is seen, you can use a space instead.  For example,
   help admin_passwords
and 
   help admin passwords
return the same document.

Also, list administrators who wish to learn about configuration settings
can omit the leading "configset_" from the topic name.  For example,
   help configset_digests
is the same as
   help digests

(The longer command represents the actual name of the help file.  This is 
important for site administrators to remember if they decide to extend the help 
system by improving or adding help files, using the get and put commands.)

Command Syntax Notation
-----------------------

Many of the help files summarize the syntax of a command in the first
few lines.  Braces ('[' and ']') indicate when a command mode or command 
argument is optional.  The basic structure of a Majordomo command is 

COMMAND[-MODE] [LIST] [ARGUMENTS]

Some commands allow multiple-line arguments using a "here document"
(see "help here_document" for more details).  The basic structure
of a multiple-line command is

COMMAND[-MODE] [LIST] [ARGUMENTS] <<TAG
[ARGUMENTS]
TAG

where...

COMMAND is a valid Majordomo command.  Each command has its own help page
        (see "help topics" for a complete list).

MODE is an extension of the command.  For example, in the "who-enhanced"
     command, "who" is the command, and "enhanced" is the command mode.

LIST is the name of a mailing list.  Mailing list names can consist of
     any combination of letters, digits, and the following characters:
       . _ -
     (period, underscore, and hyphen).

ARGUMENTS are extra information needed to complete a command.  The command
          arguments vary from command to command.

TAG marks where multi-line arguments begin and end.  It is usually three
    or more capital letters.  The same tag must be used on the first and
    last line of the command, and the tag on the last line must be on
    the line by itself, without any spaces, tabs, or other characters.

Suggestions for improvements to the Majordomo help system are welcome.
