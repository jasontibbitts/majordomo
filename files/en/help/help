     Majordomo2 - Basic Help File - updated 3 Mar 99
(more detailed help is available on many topics: see below)

Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe to and
unsubscribe from mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list archives.
This is version $VERSION of Majordomo2

This help message is from the Majordomo list management system at
     $SITE
You interact with the Majordomo software by sending commands to
     $MJ
in the body of a mail message. Please do not put your commands in the
subject! Majordomo only processes commands in the message body.  You may
put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message; put each command
on a line by itself.

For another copy of this message, send:
   help

To find out what you, as a list subscriber, can do with Majordomo
(finding out about lists, subscribing, unsubscribing, getting files
from the server, confirmations, passwords, etc.) send:
   help user overview

For a complete subscriber (or end-user) command reference, send:
   help user commands

To find out what you, as a list owner, can do with Majordomo
(altering list configurations, subscribing and unsubscribing
other people, storing files, approving posts, etc.) send:
   help admin overview

For a complete list administrator command reference, send:
   help admin commands

To get a complete list of ALL available topics, send:
   help topics

To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to the "-owner"
address which exists for every list. For example, to contact the
owner of the hypothetical list
    some-list@$WHEREAMI
you would send mail to:
    some-list-owner@$WHEREAMI

To contact a human site manager, send mail to $MJOWNER

NOTE: Majordomo 2.0 tries as hard as possible to be 
backwards-compatible with previous versions of Majordomo.  All user 
commands and many admin commands from previous versions should work; 
those that don't will provide you with a pointer to their 
replacements.
