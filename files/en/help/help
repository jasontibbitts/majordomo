Majordomo 2 is computer software that automates the distribution of
electronic mail messages on mailing lists.  The majordomo help system 
has many documents that will help you understand how Majordomo 2 works.  
All of these documents can be retrieved using the help command.

To find out what you, as a list subscriber, can do with Majordomo
(finding out about lists, subscribing, unsubscribing, getting files
from the server, confirmations, passwords, etc.) use this command:
   help overview

For a complete subscriber (or end-user) command reference, send:
   help commands

If you are the owner or moderator of a mailing list, you will want
to use one or both of the following commands to get information about
the special Majordomo commands for mailing list administration:
   help admin
   help admin_commands

There are two shortcuts available in the help system to make typing topic 
names a little easier.  The first is that anywhere an underscore, _, 
is seen, you can use a space instead.  For example,
  help admin_passwords
and 
  help admin passwords
return the same document.

Also, list administrators who wish to learn about configuration settings
can omit the leading "configset_" from the topic name.  For example,
  help configset_digests
is the same as
  help digests

(The longer command represents the actual name of the help file.  This is 
important for site administrators to remember if they decide to extend the help 
system by improving or adding help files, using the get and put commands.)

For a list of all help topics send this one-line message
   help topics
to the server at $MJ
