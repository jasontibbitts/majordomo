# addr_require_fqdn
# (yes)                [bool] <addr>
# If this is true, addresses are required to have fully qualified domain
# names.  Since Majordomo does not verify this using name service lookups,
# this essentially means that the right hand side of an address must contain
# at least one period.
#
# To enable Majordomo to run at a site where the mail transfer agents do not
# fully qualify the domain names, set this to false.
