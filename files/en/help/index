listname, required, is an email list at this site (or GLOBAL)
-recursive, if specified, lists all files in all subdirectories
-long,      if specified, lists more details about the files
pathname,   if specified, is the directory path to be indexed

This command shows the files and directories that are available from
a list, which the list owner must have previously stored there. If no
files or directories exist, or if you are not authorized to index the
list, the "index" command returns an error message.

Normally, archived posts are retrieved with "archive-get", and the
index and get commands will not allow archive retrieval if "archive_dir"
is set to somewhere outside the list's file space.

Note that "pathname" may include one or more levels of directories
(also called folders). For example, if list "MYLIST" contains a
directory called "TOPDIR" and in that directory is another directory
called "SUBDIR", then these commands would be valid:
  index MYLIST
  index MYLIST /
  index MYLIST /TOPDIR/SUBDIR
  index-recursive MYLIST
where a slash "/" separates the directory names, and a slash by
itself is the same as using no pathname at all.
