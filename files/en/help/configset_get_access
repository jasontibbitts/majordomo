EXAMPLE:
configset GLOBAL get_access = list

$INCLUDE-config/get_access

This setting determines who can use the get command to retrieve files from
a list's public file space.  

An administrative password can be used to issue the get command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the get command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
