NAME
    mj_enqueue - Add a message to the incoming message queue.

DESCRIPTION
    The mj_enqueue program is a small process that performs two tasks in the
    Majordomo queueing system for e-mail messages. First, it stores a copy
    of the message in the appropriate queue subdirectory for later
    processing by the queue runner program. Second, it attempts to contact
    the queue server program, mj_queueserv, to indicate that a message has
    arrived. If a queue server is not already running, mj_enqueue will
    attempt to start the mj_queueserv program.

    The subdirectory in which an e-mail message is stored will depend upon
    several things:

    Domain priority
        The priority of the domain to which the message was sent.

    Domain name
        The name of the domain to which the message was sent.

    Mailing list priority
        The priority of the mailing list to which the message was sent.

    Message type
        The type of message that was sent. There are four basic types:

        list
            The message is intended to be distributed to the subscribers of
            a mailing list.

        majordomo
            The message contains commands that will be processed by the
            Majordomo server.

        owner
            The message is intended to be sent to the owners or moderators
            of a mailing list.

        request
            The purpose of the message will depend upon the GLOBAL
            request_answer configuration setting. By default, commands in
            the message will be processed by the server.

    Use the "help admin_domain" and "help configset_priority" commands to
    learn more about Majordomo domains and priority numbers.
