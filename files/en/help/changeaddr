The "changeaddr" command replaces an "address" in the registration
database with the address in the sender's "From:" or "Apparently-from:"
header, including any comments. If a "default user" command is issued
first, the "From:" field of the requesting email is ignored.

Address comments in "default user" or "From:" are respected, but
comments are ignored if used in the command. These are all equivalent:
  changeaddr joe@blow.org
  changeaddr Joe Blow <joe@blow.org>
  changeaddr joe@blow.org (Joe Blow)

The registration database, and all lists to which the "address" is
subscribed, are updated. As of April 2000, "changeaddr" adjusts
aliases automatically, as does the unregister command, but it does
not yet deal with auxiliary lists

Unless the password for "address" is used, or the request comes from
"address", a confirmation token will be sent to the "address" given
on the command line AND to the address making the request (based on
the "From:" field or a "default user" command), to verify this action.

If dual confirmation is required, BOTH tokens must be replied to
with an "accept" command before the change will be made. In short:
 - Supplying the password of the new address doesn't help.
 - Supplying the password of the old address does.

NOTE: If the command is sent from the same address as used in the
command, only one confirmation will be required. This can be useful
for changing the comment fields in all subscriptions at once. For
example, if a user had previously subscribed as "Joe <joe@blow.org>"
but wanted his last name to appear also, he could fix his email
headers and send this command "From: Joe Blow <joe@blow.org>":
  changeaddr joe@blow.org
to re-register and re-subscribe, changing all occurrances of the
old address (and comments) to the same address (with new comments).
Alternately, sending these TWO commands "From: Jane Doe <jane@doe.org>":
  default user Joe Blow <joe@blow.org>
  changeaddr joe@blow.org
will have the same effect if everyone returns the confirmation tokens.
