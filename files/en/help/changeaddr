The "changeaddr" command replaces an "address" in the registration
database with the address in the sender's "From:" or "Apparently-from:"
header, including any comments. Address comments are ignored if they
exist in the command:
  changeaddr joe@blow.org
or
  changeaddr Joe Blow <joe@blow.org>
are equivalent.

The registration database, and all lists to which the "address" is
subscribed, are updated. As of April 2000, "changeaddr" adjusts
aliases automatically, as does the unregister command, but it does
not yet deal with auxiliary lists

A confirmation token will be sent to the given "address" AND to the
address making the request, to verify this action. Both tokens must
be replied to with an "accept" command, unless an authorized password
is used with "approve".
