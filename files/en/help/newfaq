The newfaq command will replace the contents of the "/faq" file
that is displayed by the faq command.

The new contents of the faq file must be included in a here document
(see "help here_document" for more details).  For example, the
following command would replace the contents of the faq file with
the sentence "Hello, subscriber!":

newfaq LISTNAME <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

The newfaq command is a convenient way to use the put command.  For
example, the following use of the put command is identical to the
newfaq command in the previous example.

put LISTNAME /faq Frequently Asked Questions <<ABCD
Hello, subscriber!
ABCD

By default, an administrative password is required to use the newfaq
command.  The access restrictions for the put command (as determined
by the access_rules configuration setting) also apply to the newfaq
command.
