$INCLUDE-config/digests

A digest is defined by a name, a description, possibly a subject header
to be used for the generated digests, and several pieces of data that
tell Majordomo when an issue should be generated.

The following substitutions are available in the subject field:

\$LIST         - The name of the list
\$DIGESTNAME   - The name of the digest
\$DIGESTDESC   - The description of the digest
\$DIGESTTYPE   - The type of the digest; see the "deftype" section below
\$MESSAGECOUNT - The number of messages included in the digest
\$VOLUME       - The current volume number
\$ISSUE        - The current issue number

Here is a brief description of the data that can be given, with
more details below:

name     - A one-word name given to the digest.  It is unwise to name
           the digest "mime", "text" or "index".

times    - The times field is a list of days and hours during which a
           digest will be issued (see "help times" for details on the
           format).  The default is "always", which allows digest creation 
           at any time, depending upon the other time and size 
           constraints.

minsize  - The minimum amount of data (measured in messages or
           kilobytes) which must be collected before a digest will be
           generated.  The default is no minimum.

maxsize  - The maximum size of digest that will be created.  Specify
           either messages or kilobytes or both as with minsize.  The
           default is no maximum.

maxage   - If an article is older than this, a digest will be created
           even if enough messages have not been collected.  This
           prevents messages from becoming "stale" on low traffic lists.

separate - The minimum amount of time that separates digests.  The
           default is 15 minutes.

minage   - A digest will not be created if it most recent article is
           younger than this.  This is intended to prevent digest
           creation in the middle of active discussion.  The default
           is no minimum age.

deftype -- This specifies the type of digest that new subscribers get
           by default. The default is MIME. Choices are listed below.

The following criteria are used to determine if a digest should be sent:

  * The digest is never sent if the current time is not within the
  limits of the "times" field.

  * The digest is never sent if the elapsed time since the last delivery
  is less than the time given in the "separate" field.

  If the "times" and "separate" criteria are met:
      
  * A digest is sent if there is a waiting message older than "maxage", 
  even if this means violating "minsize" and "minage" field limits.

  * Otherwise, a digest is sent only if: 
    + the combined size of the messages meets or exceeds the limit in the 
      "minsize" field, and

    + the number of messages meets or exceed the limit in the "minsize" 
      field, and

    + the newest message awaiting delivery is older than the "minage"
      field limit.


Each field is described in more detail in the following sections:

name
----
The name of a digest can be any single word, with some exceptions:

  * It should not be the same as a digest type (index, mime, or text).

  * It should not contain spaces, commas(','), colons (':'), or pipes ('|').

Digest names are case-insensitive.

times
-----
The times field lists days and hours during which digests are permitted
to be delivered.  The full syntax is described in the "Scheduled times" 
section of the "help times" document.  For example,

  15th(6-8) 

would allow the digest to be delivered between 6 AM and 8 AM on the 15th
day of every month.

minsize
-------
The minsize field limits the minimum size of a digest.  Each size
can be in messages or kilobytes.  More than one size can be specified
by separating the sizes with commas.  For example,

  10m requires a minimum number of 10 posted messages.

  20k gives a minimum combined size of 20 kilobytes for the messages;

  10m,20k requires that a digest meet both criteria, 10 messages and
  20 kilobytes of message data.

The default values are at least one message, and no size limit.

maxsize
-------
The maxsize field limits the number and combined size of messages
in one issue of a digest.  This field has no bearing on whether
or not a digest is issued; it only limits the contents of a particular
issue of a digest.  A digest will be issued if adding an additional
message would exceed either the number or combined size limit.  The
number limit is inclusive; for example, a limit of "10m" would mean
"10 messages or fewer," not "fewer than 10 messages."

The syntax is identical to the minsize field.

At least one message will be sent in every issue, even if that message
exceeds the size limit.

The default limits are 4 megabytes per issue, and 200 messages per
issue.

maxage
------
You can keep digests from getting stale by forcing them to be
distributed whenever they reach this age, regardless of whether the
minsize and minage limits have been reached.  For example, the value

  3d

would cause a digest to be delivered if the age of the oldest message is
greater than three days.

The syntax of this field is detailed in the "Time spans" section of the
"help times" document.

The default is no maximum age.

separate
--------

When messages come in quickly, or when a body of messages builds up
during the times that digests are not allowed to be generated, it is
possible that there are too many messages to be sent in a single digest
and perhaps enough messages to fill more than one digest.  By default,
no more than one issue of a particular digest will be delivered per
hour.  This allows digest deliveries to occur more evenly.

If this value is set to zero, multiple issues of a digest may be mailed
within a short period of time.  This is useful, for example, if you
maintain a weekly digest, and wish all issues of the digest to be
delivered together.

This field uses the same format as the maxage field.

The default value is 15 minutes.

minage
------
This field uses the same format as the maxage field.

The default value is no minimum age.

deftype
-------

When subscribers choose to receive messages in a digest, but
do not specify which format they prefer, this field determines
which format is used by default.  Three formats are supported:

  index - a summary is mailed, but the message bodies are omitted.

  mime - each post is a separate part of a MIME formatted message.

  text - all posts are concatenated in a plain text message.

See "help digest" for a detailed description of how to customize each
format.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
digests, but not within digests.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
