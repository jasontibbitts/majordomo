Data on the various digests that the list supports (not supported for sublists!).
Each digest is defined by two lines.  The first line contains data in the
following order, separated by vertical bars ('|') or colons:
  name    | times  | minsizes | maxsizes | maxage | separate | minage | deftype
The second line holds a description of the digest.

A digest is defined by a name, a description, and several pieces of data that
tell Majordomo when an issue should be generated. Here is a brief description
of the data that can be given, with more details below:

name     - A one-word name given to the digest.  It is unwise to name
           the digest "mime", "text" or "index".

times    - The times field follows the standard Majordomo syntax (see "help times").
           The times that digests are allowed to be created. The default is "always",
           which allows digest creation any time it is needed (based on maxsizes, maxage).

minsizes - The minimum amount of data (measured in messages or
           kilobytes) which must be collected before a digest will be
           generated.  The default is no minimum.

maxsizes - The maximum size of digest that will be created.  Specify
           either messages or kilobytes or both as with minsizes.  The
           default is no maximum.

maxage   - If an article is older than this, a digest will be created
           even if enough messages have not been collected.  This
           prevents messages from becoming "stale" on low traffic lists.

separate - The minimum amount of time that separates digests.

minage   - A digest will not be created if it most recent article is
           younger than this.  This is intended to prevent digest
           creation in the middle of active discussion.  The default
           is no minimum age.

deftype -- This specifies the type of digest that new subscribers get
           by default. The default is MIME. Choices are listed below.

These settings take precedence in the following order:

  A digest is always created when triggered if there is a waiting
  message older than 'maxage', even if this means violating minimum
  size limits.

  Otherwise, digests will only be created if there are enough messages
  (minsizes), the last mesage which would be included in the digest is
  old enough (minage) and the time is right (time), meaning that the
  day is proper and either the hour is in a given range or a single
  hour was given and no digest has been triggered in that hour.


NAME: You can specify a "name" of any single word, but don't use words
      that look like other important keywords (like "mime") and keep
      in mind that users will be typing the name into a "set" command
      (so it should make sense on its own).

TIMES: see "help times" for syntax.

MINSIZES: You can specify "minsizes" in messages or kilobytes
     or BOTH. A digest will be distributed only after it reaches
     this size, subject to "maxage":

     10m gives a minimum size of 10 messages;

     20k gives a minimum size of 20 kilobytes;

     and 10m, 20k will create a digest when either 10 messages
     or 20 kilobytes of message data have been collected.

MAXSIZES: see "minsizes" above for syntax

MAXAGE: You can keep digests from getting stale by forcing them
     to be distributed whenever they reach this age, regardless
     of whether the other limits have been reached:

     Specify hours like 12h, days like 4d and weeks like 2w.

     The default is no maximum age.

SEPARATE: You can choose to "separate" digests by delaying them:

     When messages come in quickly, or when a body of messages
     builds up during the times that digests are not allowed to be
     generated, it is possible that there are too many messages
     to be sent in a single digest and perhaps enough messages
     to fill more than one digest.  To prevent multiple digests
     from being generated too close to one another, set this to
     some amound of time.  To generate as many digests as
     necessary to clear out the backlog, leave this unset.

MINAGE: see "maxage" above for syntax

DEFTYPE: You can choose the type of digest for users who do not
     specify it on their "set" command line. Choose from:

     MIME - each post is a separate part of a MIME formatted message

     text - all posts are concatenated in a plain text message

     index - only a summary of posts is sent, like from "index listname"

     numbered - shows the message number, subject, and author only
                (message number can be used directly with "archive-get")


At the top of this help is an example which defines two digests.

It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
digests, but not within digests.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
