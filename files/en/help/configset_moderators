When Majordomo determines who will receive a confirmation notice, it
looks in the following places:
1. A named auxiliary list
2. The "moderators" auxiliary list
3. The "moderators" configuration setting
4. The "owners" configuration setting
5. The "whoami_owner" configuration setting
in decreasing order of precedence.  Majordomo stops search as soon as it
finds a valid address.

A named auxiliary list is used only if a rule in the access_rules
setting explicitly specifies one.  See "help auxiliary_list" for an
introduction to auxiliary lists.  See the description of the "consult"
action in the "help configset_access_rules" document for more details.

If moderators' addresses are kept in an auxiliary list instead of the
moderators setting, individual moderators can temporarily stop receiving
messages using the "nomail" delivery class.  See "help set" for more
information about delivery classes.  If an auxiliary list contains no
addresses, or if all of the addresses are in "nomail" mode, Majordomo
will continue searching for a valid address to send the confirmation
notice.

Usually, all of the moderators will receive a copy of a confirmation
message.  The moderator_group configuration setting can cause a smaller
number of moderators to be chosen randomly.

This setting is a replacement for the "moderator" setting of Majordomo
version 1.
