$INCLUDE-config/which_access

This setting determines who can use the which command to see to
which mailing lists an address is subscribed.  Restricting access
to a particular list will prevent addresses on that list from being
seen, but will not affect the results for other mailing lists.

An administrative password can be used to issue the which command,
regardless of the value of this setting.

Any rules in the access_rules setting related to the which command
will take precedence over the value of this setting.
