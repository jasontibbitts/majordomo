$INCLUDE-config/attachment_filters

Each message that is posted to a mailing list consists of one or more
body parts.  Each body part has a particular type, sometimes called a
"MIME type," which gives some indication about the contents of the part.
For example, a body part containing a WWW document might have a
"text/html" MIME type.  (MIME is an abbreviation for the name of the
Internet standard for giving names to types) 

Most plain text messages consist of one body part whose type is
"text/plain".  When a message has more than one body part, the second
and succeeding parts are usually called "attachments."  The
"attachment_filters" setting is somewhat misnamed, because the allow
and format actions apply to every body part, including the first part.

Each attachment filter occupies one line.  It is possible to place
comments before, between, and after the individual filters, to indicate to
other administrators what each filter is intended to accomplish.
Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.

The first rule that matches a particular body part takes precedence.
For example, in the following two filters:

  text/html | allow
  /^text/i  | discard

any "text/html" body part will not be changed; any other kind of text
body part, for instance "text/plain" or "text/enriched," will be
discarded.  Each part of a message body is examined separately.  If no
rule matches, the part will not be altered.

The type on the left-hand side of an access rule can be an exact MIME
type, or it can be a pattern that potentially matches many different
MIME types (see "help patterns" for an explanation of how to write
patterns).  For example, to discard all GIF images, use the following
filter:

  image/gif | discard

and to discard all images of any type, use this filter:

  /^image/i | discard

Exact MIME type matches are case-insensitive; for instance, "image/jpeg"
and "Image/JPEG" are considered identical.


The allow action
----------------
The allow action causes a body part to be passed untouched.


The discard action
------------------
The discard action causes body parts to be discarded entirely,
from every message posted to a mailing list.  For example, many messages
have "multipart/alternative" bodies, with a "text/plain" part and a
"text/html" part.  Because "text/html" parts can contain a malicious
computer virus, list owners may want to use the following attachment
rule to remove them:

text/html | discard

The discard action only applies to messages with more than one body
part.  As a result, if someone posts a message that consists only of a
"text/html" body part, the discard rule in the previous example will
have no effect.  In the following example, both filters will have an
effect, even though they both match the "text/html" MIME type:

text/html | discard
text/html | format

The first rule will cause text/html parts in multi-part messages to be
removed.  The second rule will cause text/html parts in single-part
messages to have their HTML formatting removed.

For each body part removed due to a discard action, an X-Content-Discarded
header will be added to the message when it is delivered.

The discard action should be used with caution, because it is possible
to discard every part of a multipart message.


The format action
-----------------
The format action alters message contents in two ways.  It removes
hypertext markup tags from "text/html" or "text/enriched" body parts,
and converts them into "text/plain" body parts.  It can also establish
the position of the width of the resulting text; by default, the width
of the text is 72 characters.  For example, to turn all rich text
body parts into plain text, use the following rule:

text/enriched | format

To turn all HTML body parts into text with an 80 character width,
use this rule:

text/html | format=80

For each body part changed due to a format action, an 
X-Content-Reformatted header will be added to the message when it is 
delivered.

The reformatted text will be left-justified, regardless of its original
placement.


Avoiding the filters
--------------------
If a moderated message is approved by the moderators with the
"accept-intact" command, or if a message is posted with the
"post-intact" command, none of the filters in this setting will be
applied when the message is delivered.


Unimplemented features
----------------------
The "attachment_filters" setting does not alter portions of text messages
that contain non-MIME attachments, such as uuencoded documents.
