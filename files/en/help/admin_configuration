List Configuration
------------------

All aspects of list configuration and most aspects of Majordomo
configuration are alterable remotely using the configuration interface.
This interface allows single variables or sets of variables to be retrieved
and modified individually, and for variables to be set without first
retrieving their value.  The result of a variable retrieval is a set of
commands ready to be edited and mailed back.

The Commands

The configuration interface makes use of three commands: configshow,
configset and configdefault.  In addition, the shell interface (for local
users) supports the configedit command.

Configset

configset changes the value of the given variable.  It takes as arguments
the list (or GLOBAL for global configuration), the variable to be changed,
and the value.  The value for scalar variables (those containing only a
single value) are supplied with an equals sign; array and table values are
set with the << TAG syntax (see below).

Configshow

configshow displays the value of a configuration variable.  This display
includes the commands necessary to set the variable; this makes it simple
to issue a configshow, edit the result and send it back to the server.
configshow takes the list name and a list of variables to display.  In
addition to single variables, the names of variable groups can be given in
upper case to show all of the variables belonging to the group.  The ALL
group is supported, and shows every variable currently visible.  configshow
also supports the 'comments' mode, which displays explanatory comments
(including instructions, allowed values, etc.) before the values of the
variables.

A sample set of configshow commands:

>>>> configshow test-list delivery_rules
configset test-list delivery_rules << ENDAAA
ALL
numbatches=1
ENDAAA

>>>> configshow=comments test-list token_lifetime
# token_lifetime       
# (7)                  [integer] <access,token>
# The number of days that a token will be allowed to live without being
# acknowledged (either approved or rejected).  Tokens existing longer
# than this many days are deleted at every daily trigger.
configset test-list token_lifetime = 7

The default values is shown in parentheses, the data type is shown in square
brackets, the allowed values (for 'enum' types) is shown between slashes,
and the groups that the variable belongs to are shown in angle brackets.

Note that this can be pasted directly into a reply and edited; the only
additional command required is a "default password your-password" command
at the beginning of the reply to set a default password for all of the
configset commands.  (This is required because each configset command is
not shown with a leading "approve your-password", as this would make the
lines too long.)

Note also that occasionally the produced configset commands will be broken
across lines with a backslash; this is intended to reduce the change of
line wrapping by some mailers which do not allow it to be turned off.

Configdefault

The configdefault command sets the value of a variable back to its default
value.  Not only that, but variables set to their default values will track
changes made to the defaults file, so that a change made to the defaults
file will update the values of the relevant variables in all lists that
have not set the variables otherwise.  The configdefault command takes the
list and the name of the variable to be defaulted.


The Old Interface

Note that the old Majordomo1 commands are not yet supported, but they
essentially translate like so:

  config      -> configshow=comments list ALL
  newconfig   -> not required; output of configshow contains appropriate
                 commands 
  writeconfig -> not required; config file is stored internally in a manner
                 that makes this unnecessary
