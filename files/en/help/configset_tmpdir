The tmpdir directory also stores files with debugging information for
each interface that Majordomo supports.  Over time, the debugging files
can become large, and old temporary files may accumulate.  Majordomo
does not have an internal mechanism for removing these old files.
Consequently, the tmpdir directory should be located on a disk
partition that has hundreds of megabytes of free space. 

The contents of the tmpdir directory cannot be viewed directly from
Majordomo.  It must be accessed using the Unix shell.

Debugging files end in a ".debug" extension.  It is recommended that you
rotate these files periodically.  One way to do this is to use the
following shell commands:

   cp logfile logfile.old
   cat /dev/null > logfile

This approach will leave the file ownership and protection unchanged,
both of which are crucial to collecting debug information. Moving the
file and creating a new one is less "safe", but may also work.  See
"help configset_debug" for more information on debugging files.

Some of the contents of the tmpdir directory are not temporary.
The "locks" directory contains lock files, which are removed
automatically by the mj_trigger command.  The "mj_queueserv.sock" file
is a socket which the mj_enqueue, mj_queueserv, and mj_queuerun programs
use to communicate with one another.

The remaining contents of the tmpdir directory are temporary files.
Some temporary files will have numbers in their names.  These numbers
are process IDs.  In the debugging files, each line begins with the
process ID in square brackets (e.g., [23108]).  Searching the debugging
files (with the "grep" shell command, for example) for the process ID of
a stale temporary file may give some indication of the reason Majordomo
was unable to finish its work and remove the temporary file.

The name of a temporary file can give some indication of how it was 
created.

* Files beginning with "post." contain posted messages.

* Files beginning with "owner." contain messages sent to the list
  owners or delivery failures.

* Files beginning with "unparsed." contain posted messages that
  could not be disassembled by the message parser.

* Files ending in ".mime" contain parts of messages that the message
  parser has disassembled.

* Files beginning with "mj-tmp." are messages that are being 
  mailed to a small number of people, such as a welcome message,
  confirmation notice, or a file that is retrieved with the "get"
  command.

* Files beginning with "mje." are the results of commands that were
  processed by the server.

* Files beginning with "mjr." are posted messages that are/were in the 
  process of being passed to the MTA for delivery.

Older temporary files can be deleted to conserve disk space.  Make sure
they are not recent, or you risk removing a file that is still in use.
