EXAMPLE:
configset listname digest_index_format = subject

Selects one of the formats for each line in the index listing for the
digests. The 'subject' format consists simply of the subjects of the
messages. The 'subject_author' format adds the address of the poster.
The 'numbered' format adds an additional field with the archive
message number to make retrieval easier.

Users can use "set" to choose MIME, plain text, or index style digests.
If they choose to receive an index, the list owner can determine how
much information they get... and subscribers cannot change that level
of detail with their personal settings. In general, digest_index_format
should probably be set to "numbered" except for extremely high volume
lists where the index listings would be too bulky.

1. The 'subject' format consists simply of the subjects of the messages:
  A subject
  Another subject
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject

2. The 'subject_author' format, originally provided by Jeff Wasilko,
   provides an index like this. Note that long fields cause the poster's
   address to wrap onto a second line:
  A subject                                         [User <user@example.com>]
  Another subject                      [Another User <otheruser@example.org>]
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
                                       [A Verbose user <verbose@example.com>]

3. The 'numbered' digest index always splits index entries into two lines:
  200008/12 : A subject
    user@example.com
  200008/13 : Another subject
    Another User <otheruser@example.org>
  200008/14 : A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
    A Verbose user <verbose@example.com>
