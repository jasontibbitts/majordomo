EXAMPLE:

$INCLUDE-config/digest_index_format

The 'subject' format consists simply of the subjects of the messages:
  A subject
  Another subject
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject

The 'subject_author' format, originally provided by Jeff Wasilko,
   provides an index like this. Note that long fields cause the poster's
   address to wrap onto a second line:
  A subject                                      [Ima User <user@example.com>]
  Another subject                      [Another User <otheruser@example.org>]
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
                                       [A Verbose User <verbose@example.com>]

The 'subject_name' format is similar to the subject_author format,
   but only the name of the author is displayed:
  A subject                                                        (Ima User)
  Another subject                                              (Another User)
  A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
                                                             (A Verbose User)

The 'numbered' digest index always splits index entries into two lines:
  200008/12 : A subject
    Ima User <user@example.com>
  200008/13 : Another subject
    Another User <otheruser@example.org>
  200008/14 : A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
    A Verbose User <verbose@example.com>

The 'numbered_name' digest index always splits index entries into two lines:
  200008/12 : A subject
    Ima User
  200008/13 : Another subject
    Another User
  200008/14 : A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
    A Verbose User

Digest index formats should not be confused with digest types.  The
index format only affects what information is displayed in the table of
contents.  The digest type determines the format of the messages
themselves (index, mime, or text).

Subscribers can choose which digest type they wish to receive using the
set command; however, every subscriber who receives a particular digest
will see the same index format.  Each digest in the "digests"
configuration setting can have its own index format, which will override
the default value that is established by this "digest_index_format"
setting.
