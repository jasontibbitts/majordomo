# digest_index_format  /subject,subject_author/
# (subject)            [enum] <digest>
# Selects one of the formats for each line in the index listing for the
# digests.  The 'subject' format consists simply of the subjects of the
# messages.  The 'subject_author' format, originally provided by Jeff
# Wasilko, provides an index like the following:
#
#   A subject                                         [User <user@example.com>]
#   Another subject                      [Another User <otheruser@example.org>]
#   A really, really, really, really, really really long subject
#                                        [A Verbose user <verbose@example.com>]
