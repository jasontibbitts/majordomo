The sublists setting is used to explicitly state which auxiliary
lists are given aliases and displayed by the lists-aux command.
Each line contains a sublist name (the sublist must already exist)
followed by an optional colon and description. The description is
used in the output of the lists-aux command.

If the 'A' flag is used in the aliases configuration, only auxiliary
lists mentioned here will be given aliases by the "createlist" command
(see "help configset aliases").
