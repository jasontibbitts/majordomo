$INCLUDE-config/sublists

Sublists are also called auxiliary lists.  See "help auxiliary_list" for
an introduction.

If the "auxiliary" alias is listed in the aliases configuration setting,
auxiliary lists mentioned here will be given mail aliases.  In that
case, if the value of the sublists setting is changed, the
createlist-regen command should be run afterward to the regenerate the
aliases.  See "help configset_aliases" for more information on mail
aliases.
