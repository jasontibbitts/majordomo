Retrieves the value of the given setting(s). Multiple settings can
be retrieved by listing them separated by commas or spaces. For example,
  configshow listname access_rules,delivery_rules
will cause the values of the access_rules and delivery_rules settings to 
be displayed.  The output of the configshow command is presented 
in a way that makes it easy to change the settings (see "help configset" 
for more details on changing the settings.)

If no settings are named on the command line, or if the ALL category
is used, all visible settings are shown in the output of the command.
All settings are visible if a master password is used.  If no password is 
used, only a handful of settings will be visible.

In addition to the ALL category, ten other categories are provided for
your convenience.  They include:

ACCESS      controls who has the ability to run a Majordomo command
            (not including posted messages, with the exception of 
             the access_rules setting.)

ADDRESS     controls what is considered a valid e-mail address.
            (These settings apply only to the GLOBAL pseudo-list.)

ARCHIVE     controls how archives of posted messages are stored.

BOUNCE      controls how error e-mail messages are processed.

DELIVER     controls the appearance and delivery of outgoing posted messages.

LISTS       controls the output of the lists command.

MISCELLANY  settings that do not fit any of the other categories.

MODERATE    controls whether a posted message is delivered immediately,
            stalled pending approval, or discarded.

PASSWORD    includes the administrative master password, password 
            length, and related settings.

REPLY       controls whether or not notices are sent when a majordomo
            request is stalled, fails, is completed or denied, and so on.
            Settings that control the file space and language also appear 
            in this category.

Categories should always be indicated in capital letters.  Each category
contains several settings, and some settings appear in more than one
category.  The help page for each individual setting shows the categories
to which the setting belongs.  A more detailed description of the
categories is available using the configshow-categories command.

Each configuration setting has a "wizard" level, between 1 and 9, that
indicates the importance of the setting and the level of skill required
to use it.  Settings with wizard level 1 are considered essential; you
should learn how to use these settings first.  Settings with higher
numbers are more complicated or have a specific purpose that may not
be applicable to your mailing list.  To see the essential settings,
use the following command:

  configshow LISTNAME 1

(Substitute the name of your list for LISTNAME.)

Unless the '-nocomments' option is used, explanatory information about
the setting(s) will also be shown.  More information about each
configuration setting, the setting's help file. For example, to learn
more about the which_access setting, see "help configset_which_access".

The value of each setting is presented as a configset command.  This
allows you to edit the current value, then send the command back to
Majordomo.  You will need to add your list's administrative password to
the commands before sending them; see "help admin_passwords" for
instructions.

Whenever a list owner uses a configset command to alter a configuration
setting, the new value is recorded in the list's configuration file.
As a result, any default value for the setting will be overridden,
even if the new value is the same as the default value.  To prevent
this happening, use the configshow-noforce command.

The "declared" mode causes only those settings which have overridden 
the default values to be displayed.  In effect, this gives list
owners the opportunity to see only those values that they have
personally changed.

The "append" mode causes the configset commands to be displayed as
"configset-append" commands, if the value of the setting can occupy more
than one line.  The "extract" mode causes the configset commands to be
displayed as "configset-extract" commands.   The "noforce" command mode
causes the configset commands to be displayed as "configset-noforce"
commands.  See "help configset" for an explanation of these three
command modes.

The "merge" mode causes the configset commands to be displayed as if
they were intended to alter the second mailing list on the command line.
This is useful for people who want to apply the current settings for one
list to another list.  If the first list is a DEFAULT list, any
non-password settings will be shown.  This feature allows list owners to
view the settings in public configuration templates.

The "append," "extract," and "merge" modes all have the same effect as
"declared" mode:  they only display values that have been explicitly set
by the list owners.

Occasionally the produced configset commands will be broken across lines
with a backslash.  This is intended to reduce the likelihood of lines
being wrapped improperly by the software that you use to write mail
messages.

Note also that only the settings that can be seen by the current
authorization level will be returned.  This means that with no
authentication at all, a small list of settings will still be visible
(though of course they cannot be modified). Finally, note that not all
per-list settings can be modified by the list owner - some require
global priviliges. Refer to the help file for each configset setting for
about passwords and visibility.

It is possible to store more than one collection of configuration
settings in a mailing list using a configuration "template."  Templates
have the same naming conventions as a mailing list: only letters,
numbers, period, hyphen, and underscore are allowed.  The template name
is case-insensitive.  Templates are used to store a collection of
settings for later use.  For example, the message_headers,
delete_headers, and bounce_probe_frequency settings could be used to
cause the messages to a list to have personalized To: headers.  Instead
of having to remember the necessary settings, a list owner could simply
refer to a template by name, using the "configshow-merge" command to
apply the settings to his mailing list.

To refer to a template, append a colon and the name of the template to
the name of the mailing list.  For example, to see a template named
"personalize" with the DEFAULT pseudo-list, use the following command:

configshow-declared DEFAULT:personalize

This will cause all existing settings in the template to be displayed.
If the template does not exist, you will receive a message indicating
that no settings were found.  

A complete list of default templates can be seen using the 
following command:

  lists-config DEFAULT

See "help lists" for more details.

Templates can be applied to your list using the config_defaults
configuration setting.

The level of authorization required to see the value of a configuration
setting, and the wizard level of a setting, can be customized with the
config_access configuration setting.

A complete list of settings appears in the "help topics" document.
