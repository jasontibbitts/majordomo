Retrieves the value of the given variable(s). Multiple variables can
be retrieved by listing them separated by commas. Listing no variable
name at all retrieves the complete list of variables. In addition to
single variables or combinations of variables, the names of variable
groups can be given in upper case to show all of the variables
belonging to the group. The ALL group is supported, and shows every
variable currently visible.

Unless the '-nocomments' option is used, explanatory information about
the variable(s) will be returned as well. The default values is shown
in parentheses, the data type is shown in square brackets, the allowed
values (for 'enum' types) is shown between slashes, and the group(s)
that the variable belongs to are shown in angle brackets.

The response is in such a form that it can be fed back to the parser
verbatim.  It is essentially a series of configset commands, which may
be edited at will and sent back to the parser. You will need to put
a "default password" line before most configshow outputs before
using them as configset commands since they are altering the list.

Occasionally the produced configset commands will be broken across
lines with a backslash; this is intended to reduce the change of line
wrapping by some mailers which do not allow it to be turned off.

Note also that only the variables that can be seen by the current
authorization level will be returned.  This means that with no
authentication at all, a small list of variables will still be visible
(though of course they cannot be modified).

Finally, note that not all per-list variables can be modified by the
list owner. Some require global priviliges.

A complete list of variables is included in "help configset".
