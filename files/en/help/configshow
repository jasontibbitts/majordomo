Retrieves the value of the given setting(s). Multiple settings can
be retrieved by listing them separated by commas or spaces. For example,
  configshow listname access_rules,delivery_rules
will cause the values of the access_rules and delivery_rules settings to 
be displayed.  The output of the configshow command is presented 
in a way that makes it easy to change the settings (see "help configset" 
for more details on changing the settings.)

If no settings are named on the command line, or if the ALL category
is used, all visible settings are shown in the output of the command.
All settings are visible if a master password is used.  If no password is 
used, only a handful of settings will be visible.

In addition to the ALL category, ten other categories are provided for
your convenience.  They include:

ACCESS      controls who has the ability to run a Majordomo command
            (not including posted messages, with the exception of 
             the access_rules setting.)

ADDRESS     controls what is considered a valid e-mail address.
            (These settings apply only to the GLOBAL pseudo-list.)

ARCHIVE     controls how archives of posted messages are stored.

BOUNCE      controls how error e-mail messages are processed.

DELIVER     controls the appearance and delivery of outgoing posted messages.

LISTS       controls the output of the lists command.

MISCELLANY  settings that do not fit any of the other categories.

MODERATE    controls whether a posted message is delivered immediately,
            stalled pending approval, or discarded.

PASSWORD    includes the administrative master password, password 
            length, and related settings.

REPLY       controls whether or not notices are sent when a majordomo
            request is stalled, fails, is completed or denied, and so on.
            Settings that control the file space and language also appear 
            in this category.

Categories should always be indicated in capital letters.  Each category
contains several settings, and some settings appear in more than one
category.  The help page for each individual setting shows the categories
to which the setting belongs.  A more detailed description of the
categories is available using the configshow-categories command.

Unless the '-nocomments' option is used, explanatory information about
the setting(s) will be returned as well. The default values is shown
in parentheses, the data type is shown in square brackets, the allowed
values (for 'enum' types) is shown between slashes, and the group(s)
that the setting belongs to are shown in angle brackets. More syntax
and usage information about each configset setting, including the
list of possible values, who can change it, etc,  can be found in
the corresponding help file, such as "help configset which_access".

The response is in such a form that it can be fed back to the parser
verbatim.  It is essentially a series of comments and configset commands,
which may be edited at will and sent back to the parser. You will need
to put a "default password" line before most configshow outputs before
using them as configset commands since they are altering the list.

Whenever a list owner uses a configset command to alter a configuration
setting, the new value is recorded in the list's configuration file.
As a result, any default value for the setting will be overridden,
even if the new value is the same as the default value.

The "declared" mode causes only those settings which have overridden 
the default values to be displayed.  In effect, this gives list
owners the opportunity to see only those values that they have
personally changed.

The "append" mode causes the configset commands to be displayed
as "configset-append" commands, if the value of the setting can
occupy more than one line.  The "extract" mode causes the configset
commands to be displayed as "configset-extract" commands.  See
"help configset" for an explanation of these two command modes.

The "merge" mode causes the configset commands to be displayed
as if they were intended to alter the second mailing list on
the command line.  This is useful for people who want to apply
the current settings for one list to another list.  If the first
list is a DEFAULT list, any non-password settings will be shown.
This feature allows list owners to view the settings in public
configuration templates.

The "append," "extract," and "merge" modes all have the same effect
as "declared" mode:  they only display values that have been
explicitly set by the list owners.

Occasionally the produced configset commands will be broken across
lines with a backslash; this is intended to reduce the change of line
wrapping by some mailers which do not allow it to be turned off.

Note also that only the settings that can be seen by the current
authorization level will be returned.  This means that with no
authentication at all, a small list of settings will still be visible
(though of course they cannot be modified). Finally, note that not
all per-list settings can be modified by the list owner - some
require global priviliges. Refer to the help file for each configset
setting for about passwords and visibility.

It is possible to store more than one collection of configuration
settings in a mailing list using a configuration "template."  
Templates have the same naming conventions as a mailing list:
only letters, numbers, period, hyphen, and underscore are allowed.
The template name is case-insensitive.  Templates are used to
store a collection of settings for later use.  For example,
the message_headers, delete_headers, and bounce_probe_frequency
settings could be used to cause the messages to a list to have
personalized To: headers.  Instead of having to remember the
necessary settings, a list owner could simply refer to a
template by name, using the "configshow-merge" command to apply
the settings to his mailing list.

To refer to a template, append a colon and the name of the template
to the name of the mailing list.  For example, to see a template
named "personalize" with the DEFAULT pseudo-list, use the following
command:

configshow-declared DEFAULT:personalize

This will cause all existing settings in the template to be displayed.
If the template does not exist, you will receive a message indicating
that no settings were found.  

A complete list of settings is included in "help topics".
