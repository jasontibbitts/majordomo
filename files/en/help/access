used only in "configset access_rules" for the GLOBAL pseudo-list

The access command is used only in the access_rules configuration
setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. 

The access command allows domain managers to restrict access to all
of majordomo's features to certain e-mail addresses. For example,
a domain administrator could create an auxiliary list, badguys,
and use this access_rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
@badguys
ENDTAG

Then, anyone who repeatedly violated the site administrator's rules
could be banned using the subscribe command. Alternatively, the banned
users could be listed in the command itself, as with

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
/joe\@example.com/i OR /jane\@example.com/i
ENDTAG

When access is denied in this way, all of the features of Majordomo
are restricted, including messages sent to the list owners, messages
posted to mailing lists, or commands sent to the server.
