The access command is used only in the access_rules configuration
setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. 

The access command allows domain managers to restrict access to all
of majordomo's features to certain e-mail addresses.  For example,
a domain administrator could create an auxiliary list, badguys,
and use this access_rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
@badguys
ENDTAG

Alternatively, the banned users could be listed in the command itself, as
with:

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
/joe\@example.com/i OR /jane\@example.com/i
ENDTAG

Thus, anyone who repeatedly violated the site administrator's rules could
be banned from issuing majordomo commands.  When access is denied in this
way, all of the features of Majordomo are restricted, including messages
sent to the list owners using the <list>-owner alias, messages posted to
mailing lists, or commands sent to the server.

Two special cases have to be considered when GLOBAL access is
restricted.  The mj_trigger program, which causes digests to be
delivered and expired data to be removed, runs with an anonymous
address, "unknown@anonymous".  The WWW interfaces use the IP address of
the client and the "example.com" domain, for example,
"127.0.0.1@example.com".  If these addresses are not permitted access,
the interfaces that use them will not work.
