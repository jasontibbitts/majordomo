used only in "configset access_rules" for the GLOBAL pseudo-list

The "access" command is used only in majordomo's access_rules 
configuration setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. There must
be several lines of data after the access command, as described
by "help configset access_rules".

The access command allows site managers to restrict access to all
of majordomo's features to certain e-mail addresses. For example,
a  site administrator could create an auxiliary group, badguys,
and use this access_rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
@badguys
ENDTAG

Then, anyone who repeatedly violated the site administrator's
rules could be banned using the "auxadd" command. ALternatively,
the banned users could be listed in the command itself, as with

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reply="Request denied.  Your address has been blacklisted."
/joe\@nowhere.com/i OR /jane\@somewhere.com/i
ENDTAG

Majordomo determines the author's address under any circumstances,
including when sending messages to the list owners, so access to
any feature can be limited by access_rules.
