used only in "configset access_rules" for the GLOBAL pseudo-list

The access command is used only in the access_rules configuration
setting, and only for the GLOBAL list. 

The access command allows domain managers to restrict access to all
of majordomo's features to certain e-mail addresses.  For example,
a domain administrator could create an auxiliary list, badguys,
and use this access_rule:
 
configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reason="This address has been blacklisted."
@badguys
ENDTAG

Alternatively, the banned users could be listed in the rule, for
example:

configset GLOBAL access_rules << ENDTAG
access
deny, reason="This address has been blacklisted."
/joe\@example.com/i OR /jane\@example.com/i
ENDTAG

Thus, anyone who repeatedly violated the domain managers' rules could be
banned from the domain entirely.  When access is denied in this way, all
of the features of Majordomo are restricted, including messages sent to
the list owners, messages posted to mailing lists, or commands sent to
the server.

The following actions are supported for the "access" command in the
access_rules setting:  allow, deny, mailfile, reason, reply, and
replyfile.  

When access is denied, a reply message is not usually sent to the person
who was denied access.  Instead, any explanations given by reason,
reply, or replyfile actions in the access rules will be added the
"inform" message that is sent to the domain administrators.

The "mailfile" action can be used to send a message to the address 
that was denied access.  For example, the following rule would send
the "/access_blocked" file to anyone denied access by the block_headers
configuration setting:

access
mailfile=/access_blocked
$block

By default, access will be allowed unless a message matches one of the
patterns in the block_headers setting.  See "help configset_block_headers"
for more details.

Two special cases have to be considered when GLOBAL access is
restricted.  The mj_trigger program, which causes digests to be
delivered and expired data to be removed, runs with an anonymous
address, "unknown@anonymous".  The WWW interfaces use the IP address of
the client and the "example.com" domain, for example,
"127.0.0.1@example.com".  If these addresses are not permitted access,
the interfaces that use them will not work.
