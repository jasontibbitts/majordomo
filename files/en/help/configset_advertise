If the requestor name matches one of these regexps, then the list will
not be listed in the output of a lists command.  Noadvertise overrides
advertise.
If address matches in 'advertise', show the list no matter what
settings are in place for 'noadvertise'.

See "help configset noadvertise" for more details, including how to
use access_rules to replace both advertise and noadvertise.
