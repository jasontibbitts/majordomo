The trigger command is only available by running the mj_trigger program.
This program is run once an hour to perform a variety of tasks, such as
delivering message digests and removing expired data from the databases. 
The "triggers" and "digests" configuration settings control which tasks
are run during any given hour.

See Also:
   help admin_config
   help configset_digests
   help configset_triggers (for how to configure periodic tasks)
   help mj_trigger
