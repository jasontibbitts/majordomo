A table containing delivery rules, which describe how Majordomo will
deliver mail.  In the simplest form, you can specify a host to use for
delivery and a batch size.  (This duplicates much of the functionality
of bulk_mailer, for those familiar with it.) Smaller batch sizes will
keep malformed addresses from killing the entire delivery, but the
optimal batch size depends on your mail handler and net connections.

Each delivery destination should begin with a line containing either a
regular expression, or the word ALL.  Addreses are compared against
these in order; the first matching destination is chosen.  This
enables you to choose which addresses go to which sets of hosts.

The remaining lines (up until the next blank) should consist of
various parameters which affect delivery.  The possible parameters
are:

numbatches=N
  Split the address list up into exactly N batches.

maxaddrs=N
  Split the list into batches of N addresses apiece.

maxdomains=N
  Split the address list into batches of N domains apiece.

minseparate=N
  If a domain appears more than N times in various addresses, they
  will all be given a separate batch.

If neither of the above are specified, the default is numbatches=1,
which duplicates the Majordomo 1.x behavior.

hosts=(hosta, hostb, hostc)
  A list of hostnames that Majordomo will connect to to deliver
  batches.  If no hosts are given, Majordomo connects to localhost.

backup=(hostd, hoste, hostf)
  A list of backup hosts to use in case one or more of the regular
  delivery hosts are down.

sort
  Sort the address list.  Many of the batching options depend on
  getting the addresses in sorted order and will not work as expected
  if the address are unsorted.

Hosts in either the hosts or backup lists can also be specified with
additional information, as follows:

hosts=(hosta=(parameter1, param2=5), hostb=(param3), hostc)

The host parameters are as follows:

esmtp      - speak ESMTP with the hosts if it is able.
onex       - send ESMTP ONEX to the host if it supports it.
pipelining - send the ESMTP PIPELINING command to the host.
timeout    - the number of seconds to wait when opening a connection
             to the host
port       - the port number to connect to, if different from the
             usual SMTP port.

If, instead of a host name, the string "@qmail" is used, Majordomo
will open a direct connection to the qmail-queue program and directly
inject the message into the qmail delivery system.  This assumes, of
course, that you are running qmail.

More complicated forms allow you specify a list of hosts to be used
for parallel delivery, and to specify more powerful batching parameters.

The most general form allows various addresses to be directed to
different sets of hosts for delivery.

The maxdomains parameter differs from maxaddrs in that a batch can
contain more than N addresses if several of them are in the same domain.
This requires a sorted address list to function completely.

The minseparate parameter can improve the average delivery time quite
a bit if you have many addresses at large providers, since they will
be delivered immediately without waiting for other addresses.

Domains that do not appear more than N times are batched according
to maxdomains, which should also be specified in order to set the
batch size for the infrequently occurring hosts.  If maxdomains is
not also specified, maxdomains=20 is used.

Batches are delivered to each host in the "hosts" parameter in a
round-robin fashion. (Future enhancements will deliver batches to
each host simultaneously to compensate for possible delays from
individual hosts due to load or network traffic.) The hosts in
this list are randomly reordered, so even if you use a single
batch the load will be spread out over several messages.

Hosts in the "backup" parameter will normally be ignored, but if
there is a problem contacting one of the normal delivery hosts,
these hosts will be used in addition to the other working hosts.
In the event that no host is contactable, Majordomo will attempt
to contact localhost.  If that fails, Majordomo will sleep for
ten minutes and try the whole process again.

A particular host name should be used no more than once in the 
"hosts" and "backup" parameters.  If a host name is used more than
once, the last set of options will take precedence, and declarations
in "backup" will override declarations in "hosts".

Including the "sort" option causes the list to be sorted, but beware
that this takes time and memory. This is not necessary (and will
have no effect) when using a sorted database backend.  A reasonable
balance can be struck by sorting the list periodically (using the
sortlist command) and not sorting here.


Examples (these are all separate):

1. Duplicate bulk_mailer:
configset listname delivery_rules << ENDA
ALL
sort, maxdomains=20
ENDA

2. Use a remote exploder for Scandinavia:
configset listname delivery_rules << ENDb
/(.fi|.no|.se)$/
hosts=(nordland.no=(esmtp, onex), reallycold.se)
backup=(my.host.com)
numbatches=2
ENDB

3. Use a single host:
configset listname delivery_rules << ENDC
ALL
numbatches=1
hosts=(my.host.com)
ENDC
