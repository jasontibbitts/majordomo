$INCLUDE-config/delivery_rules

Rules must be separated from one another with blank lines.

The first line of each rule must contain either a Majordomo pattern or
the word ALL.  For each recipient of a message, the first rule that
matches the address of the recipient is used.  See "help patterns" for
more information about Majordomo patterns.  The "ALL" pattern matches
any address, so any rule that follows a rule with the ALL pattern will
be ignored.  

The second and succeeding lines of each rule contain parameters that
describe the SMTP servers that will perform the actual delivery.  

hosts=(hostname1=(parameter), hostname2, hostname3)
  By default, Majordomo will connect to localhost, port 25 to contact an
  SMTP server which will deliver the mail.  The "hosts" parameter can be
  used to select a server at a different location, or using a different
  port number.  

  If more than one host is specified, these hosts will be used in
  round-robin fashion to handle each batch of recipients to which
  a message is being delivered.

backup=(hostname1, hostname2=(parameter=value))
  If the primary hosts in the "hosts" parameter are unresponsive, the
  hosts in the "backup" parameter will be used.  By default, the SMTP
  server on localhost, port 25 is used.  As with the hosts parameter, if
  more than one host is specified, the hosts will be used in round-robin
  fashion.  

  A particular host name should be used no more than once in the "hosts"
  and "backup" parameters.  If a host name is used more than once, the
  last set of options will take precedence, and declarations in "backup"
  will override declarations in "hosts".

maxaddrs=N
  Split the message recipients into batches of N addresses apiece.

  The maxaddrs parameter will override the numbatches parameter if
  both are set.

maxdomains=N
  Split the message recipients into batches of N domains apiece.

  The maxdomains parameter differs from maxaddrs in that a batch can
  contain more than N addresses if several of them are in the same domain.
  This requires a sorted address list to function completely.

  The minseparate parameter will override the maxaddrs or numbatches
  parameter if both are set.

minseparate=N
  If more than N recipients have the same e-mail domain, they will be 
  assigned a separate batch.

  The minseparate parameter can improve the average delivery time quite a
  bit if you have many addresses at large providers, since they will be
  delivered immediately without waiting for other addresses.

  The minseparate parameter will override the maxaddrs or numbatches
  parameter if both are set.

  If the minseparate parameter and the maxdomains parameter are both
  set, both will be used.

numbatches=N
  Divide the message recipients into exactly N batches.

sort
  Sort the address list by domain.  

  Including the "sort" option causes the list to be sorted, but beware
  that this takes time and memory.  This option will have no effect unless
  Majordomo is configured to store its information in plain text database
  files.

Unless the host parameters specify otherwise, the recipients will not
be separated into batches.  

When messages are posted to a mailing list, any recipients who have had recent
delivery problems ("bounced" messages) will receive an individual copy
of a message.  This keeps unreliable addresses from slowing down delivery 
to the other subscribers.  The same applies to any recipients that are
subject to bounce probes (see "help configset_bounce_probe_frequency"
and "help configset_bounce_probe_pattern" for more details.)

Hosts specified with the "hosts" or "backup" parameters can be
customized using other parameters.  The following parameters are
available:

dsn        
  Delivery status notifications can sometimes result in better tracking
  of delivery errors.

esmtp
  At the beginning of an ESMTP session, the EHLO command will be 
  used to determine which capabilities (dsn, onex, or pipelining) the 
  SMTP server possesses.  If the server does not understand the EHLO
  command, the HELO command will be used instead, and the dsn, onex
  and pipelining features will not be available.

onex
  The ESMTP ONEX command is used to tell the Sendmail SMTP server that
  only "one transaction" will take place during an SMTP session.  This
  results in a mild reduction in the computer resources needed to
  handle the session.

pipelining
  If pipelining is supported by the SMTP server, Majordomo will not
  wait for a response from the server to a RCPT command before
  indicating the next recipient to the server.  This may result in
  somewhat faster delivery for a large batch of recipients.

port=N
  The usual port number of an SMTP server is 25.  This parameter can
  be used to specify a different number.
             
timeout=N
  During an SMTP session, Majordomo will wait a limited amount
  of time for a response to an SMTP command.  By default, this
  value is 60 seconds.  Majordomo will wait up to five times the 
  value of this setting for responses to RCPT commands, unless
  the "pipelining" feature is turned on.

If the dsn, onex, or pipelining parameter is used, the esmtp parameter
must also be specified.

If, instead of a host name, the word "@qmail" is used, e.g.,

  ALL
  hosts=(@qmail)

then Majordomo will open a direct connection to the qmail-queue program
and directly inject the message into the qmail delivery system.  This
assumes, of course, that you are running qmail.


                                Examples

Duplicate bulk_mailer
---------------------
The addresses will be sorted, and the recipients of each batch will contain 
no more than 20 mail domains.

configset listname delivery_rules << ENDA
ALL
sort, maxdomains=20
ENDA


Use a remote host
----------------- 
Destinations in Scandinavia will be handled by example.no or example.se.
All other destinations will be handled by localhost.

configset listname delivery_rules << ENDB
/\.(dk|no|se)$/
hosts=(example.no=(esmtp, onex, timeout=120), example.se)
backup=(localhost=(esmtp, pipelining, dsn))
numbatches=2

ALL
maxaddrs=40
hosts=(localhost=(esmtp, pipelining, dsn))
ENDB


It is possible to use comments before, between, and after the individual
rules, but not within rules.  Comments are lines that begin with a '#'.
