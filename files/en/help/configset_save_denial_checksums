If set (any value other than 0), the checksums for the body of a posted
message will be saved even if that message is denied by the access rules.
If the checksums are saved, any succeeding message with an identical
body will be regarded as a duplicate. If not set, or set to zero, posts
which are not distributed will not cause future posts to be rejected.

This variable can be used to fix the following problem: A person not
subscribed to a list tries to post, but the list is configured to only
allow subscriber posts. The person receives an informative bounce, and
follows the instructions to become a subscriber. Once subscribed, the
person tries to post again, and is rejected because the post is seen
as a duplicate. Setting save_denial_checksums to 0 avoids this.

Note that this variable applies to individual lists, but requires
the global password. Also note that it is not a boolean even though
"0" and "not 0" are the only currently defined options. (No reasons
are available for these two notes as of 4/2000, but you should use
either 0 or 1 in case the variable becomes a boolean in the future.)

See "help configset access_rules" for how to sent notices about
checksums and other rules that cause posts to bounce.
