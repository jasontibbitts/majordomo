$INCLUDE-config/save_denial_checksums

This setting can be used to correct the following problem: A person not
subscribed to a list tries to post, but the list is configured to deny
posted messages. The person receives an informative notice explaining
why the message was denied, and follows the instructions to become a
subscriber. Once subscribed, the person tries to post again, but the
message is denied again because the post is seen as a duplicate.
Setting save_denial_checksums to 0 will avoid this problem.

See "help configset_access_rules" for more information on restricting
access for posted messages.
