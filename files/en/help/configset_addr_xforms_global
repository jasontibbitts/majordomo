# addr_xforms
# (empty)              [xform_array] <addr>
# A list of transformations to be applied to addresses before comparing
# them for equivalency.  This can be used to remove the '+mailbox' part
# of an address, or to remove the machine name from addresses in a
# domain.  Transforms should listed one per line, and should be in the
# form /pattern/replacement/.  For example, /(.*?)\\+.*(\\@.*)/\$1\$2/
# removes the '+mailbox' specifier from an address.  NOTE: these
# transforms must give the same result when applied multiple times in
# succession.
