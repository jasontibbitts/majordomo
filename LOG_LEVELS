Functions that are called very often and have very simple code or
predictable results should be logged at a very high level so as to not
pollute the logging results.  Otherwise, try to log in the following
ranges:

1   -  25: Emergencies anywhere.
26  -  50: Important External interface functions
51  - 100: Important core Majordomo functions
101 - 150: Unimportant interface functions
150 - 200: Unimportant core functions

Consider just removing logging from anything you want to put at a lower
level, at least for production.  In fact, for production we should probably
make a script to comment out really low logging info.

150 - Config file loading + saving
155 - Config-file sub-saving
160 - Config file sub-loading
170 - Config defaulting
180 - Config::get and upstream callers
200 - Majordomo::list_legal_name

Do note that currently the code doesn't really pay much attention to these,
but it needs to.
