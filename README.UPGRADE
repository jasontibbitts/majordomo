Notes on upgrading from alpha1 or before:

Before installing, the sessions directory must be moved to its new
location.  (This provides a performance improvement.)  Rename
GLOBAL/files/sessions to GLOBAL/files in each domain.  Then make;make
install and run a filesync GLOBAL in each domain.

There are new Makefile.PL questions; be sure to rerun it and go through the
questions again.  Things are likely to misbehave if the proper
configuration options are not defined properly (or at all).
