Notes on upgrading from alpha1 or before:

New aliases are required and a new config variable must be set properly.
Use createlist-force on each list with its proper owner to do this, and
update your aliases from the returned information.

Before installing, the sessions directory must be moved to its new
location.  (This provides a performance improvement.)  Rename
GLOBAL/files/sessions to GLOBAL/files in each domain.  Then make;make
install and run a filesync GLOBAL in each domain.

There are new Makefile.PL questions; be sure to rerun it and go through the
questions again.  Things are likely to misbehave if the proper
configuration options are not defined properly (or at all).

You must answer 'y' to the "Create directories" prompt after make install
in order to creat the new lock directory.  You can also delete any and all
'.L' files that may exist in your lists directory.

The archiving scheme has changed completely; any archives that may have
been collected using previous versions need to be moved out of the way and
all of the dotfiles need to be deleted.  The new archiving scheme will
automatically start if an archive directory exists under public in the
list's filespace.  Mj2 will automatically create a .index directory under
that to store the indices.  As of yet there is no tool to convert archives
to the new format.  The archive-related config variables have also changed;
look over the settings of archive_split and archive_size.
