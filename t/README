Some things to think about for a test suite.  We have to have one; there's
too much for me to test as it is and deep changes are still being made.
This means that a change in, say, list_access_check can break just about
everything that a user sees.

The email interface in particular is quite complicated with all of the
parsing of attachments and such.  Testing all of these is not easy.

The shell interface provides a convenient interface for testing out the
core functions.

The concept of separate domains provides a simple mechanism for setting up
a controlled environment for testing.

So a simple test suite should:

1. create a 'test' domain and some lists in it.
2. perform operations directly on that set of lists:
    lists
    add some users
    alias
    lists
    lists=enhanced
    who
    which
    set access_table (limit lists, which, etc.)
    lists
    which
    remove some users, including one through an alias
    who
    which
