=head1 NAME

mj_shutdown - Ask a running queue server to exit.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mj_shutdown>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The mj_shutdown program sends a message to the mj_queueserv program
which asks the queue server to exit.  The mj_queueserv process is not
killed.  Any existing queue runners are allowed to finish (They will
notice that the queue server has stopped running when they request more
work.)

The mj_shutdown program must be run by the majordomo user.

=head2 Options

The mj_shutdown program supports the following command line option:

=over 4

=item B<-t> I<delay>

Normally, the queue server will be asked to shut down immediately.
If this option is used, the queue server will wait for I<delay>
seconds before exiting.  This option is useful for delaying message
processing while the software is being upgraded.
