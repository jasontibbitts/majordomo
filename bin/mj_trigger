=head1 NAME

mj_trigger - Simple Majordomo event trigger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mj_trigger> B<-t> trigger_type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

mj_trigger is a program designed to be put into the Majordomo user''s
crontab and called periodically to inform Majordomo that it is time to
execute its periodic functions.

Majordomo currently understands hourly and daily functions.

A sample crontab entry looks like:

  # Expire locks at midnight
  0 0 * * * /path/to/mj_trigger -t lock
  # Run the hourly trigger at the top of each hour
  0 * * * * /path/to/mj_trigger -t hourly

Several functions are performed by the triggers, and each has a separate
argument to the C<-t> switch:

=over 4

=item B<bounce>

Expire bounce data, which is controlled by the I<bounce_max_age>
configuration setting.

=item B<checksum>

Expire duplicate message checksums and message-ids, as indicated by the
I<dup_lifetime> configuration setting.

=item B<delay>

Complete delayed requests.

=item B<digest>

Issue digests, as indicated by the I<digests> configuration setting.

=item B<inactive>

Remove registered addresses and subscriptions that have been inactive
for too long.  The maximum period of inactivity is determined by the
I<inactive_lifetime> configuration setting.

=item B<log>

Remove log entries older in days than the I<log_lifetime> configuration
setting.

=item B<post>

Remove old statistics for posted messages.  The expiration age is
determined by the I<post_lifetime> configuration setting.

=item B<session>

Remove session data older than the I<session_lifetime> setting.

=item B<token>

Send reminders, and expire old requests and temporary passwords (as
required by the I<token_remind>, I<token_lifetime>, and
I<latchkey_lifetime> settings).

=item B<vacation>

Restore the delivery mode of subscribers whose vacation periods have
expired.

=back

Excepting B<digest>, which has its own setting, these triggers are
invoked by the B<daily> trigger, or by the B<hourly> trigger at the
times indicated by the I<triggers> configuration setting.
