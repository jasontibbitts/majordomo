=head1 NAME

mj_shell - Majordomo command line interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mj_shell> [B<-D>] [B<-d> domain] [B<-t> topdir] [B<-p> password] [command [args]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<mj_shell> provides a command line interface to the Majordomo core
functionality.  It provides both a single command interface, where a
command is given directly on the command line, and an interface into the
full text parser, where commands are parsed out of a file.  Anything that
can be done through the email interface can be done through the shell
interface.

B<mj_shell> also provides a convenient 'configedit' command that opens an
editor on a set of config variables and allows them to be edited directly.

=head2 Executing single commands

B<mj_shell> allows the user to execute a single command directly, just by
placing it and its arguments on the command line:

  mj_shell who mylist
  mj_shell subscribe mylist whoever@example.com

For a list of supported commands, execute

  mj_shell help commands

=head2 Passwords

The B<-p> switch specifies that the command should be executed with the
given password.  For general information on how passwords work in
Majordomo, execute

  mj_shell help admin passwords

=head2 Command modes

The specific behavior of most of the commands can be altered through the
use of command modes.  Most commands take the 'noinform' and 'nolog' modes,
which turn off owner information and logging, respectively.  The
B<subscribe> command takes the 'nowelcome' mode, which prevents the
introductory welcome message from being sent out to new subscribers.

To specify one or more modes, separate them with commas and attach them to
the command with an equals sign, as follows:

  mj_shell -p pass subscribe=noinform,nowelcome mylist user@example.com

For information on which commands take which modes, execute

  mj_shell help admin commands

=head2 Commands taking multiple or array arguments

Some commands, like B<subscribe>, can take multiple arguments (in this
case, a list of addresses to subscribe).  Others, like B<configset>,
sometimes take array arguments.  These are handled in B<mj_shell> by
placing the multiline part of the command in a file and specifying the file
using the B<-f> switch.  For example, if 'addr_file' contains a list of
addresses, one per line, you can do the following:

  mj_shell -p pass -f addr_file subscribe=noinform,nowelcome mylist

For another example, if the file 'inform_file' contains the following:

  subscribe   : all : ignore
  unsubscribe : all : ignore

Then

  mj_shell -p pass -f inform_file configset mylist inform

would set the inform variable such that the list owner would not be
informed of subscribe and unsubscribe requests.  (Execute

  mj_shell help admin config

for more information about configuration variables.)

=head2 Executing multiple commands

For performing more involved tasks, B<mj_shell> gives access to the full
Majordomo text parser, which is also used to parse commands from the body
of an email message.  Place multiple commands in a file, and pass the
filename to B<mj_shell> using the B<-F> switch.

For example, if 'cmd_file' contains the following lines:

  subscribe mylist usera@example.com
  subscribe mylist userb@example.com
  show mylist usera@example.com
  show mylist userb@example.com

all of the commands can be executed by calling B<mj_shell> as follows:

  mj_shell -p pass -F cmd_file

The text parser also allows some advanced features.  Multiline arguments
can be specified by a syntax similar to the shell 'here document' feature.
An example is simpler than a description; you could place the following in
'cmd_file':

  subscribe mylist << ENDA
  usera@example.com
  userb@example.com
  ENDA

  show mylist << ENDB
  usera@example.com
  userb@example.com
  ENDB

  configset mylist inform << AAA
  subscribe   : all : ignore
  unsubscribe : all : ignore
  AAA

to additionally set the 'inform' variable.  (In this example the syntax is
not much shorter, but for longer address lists it can save much typing.)
The '<<' begins the multiline argument, and must be at the end of the
command line.  The tag must consist of at least three uppercase letters,
and appears both directly after the '<<' and alone on a line after all of
the data.

Multiline arguments can also be included in external files.  The external
files given using one or more B<-f> options on the B<mj_shell> command
line, and their contents are referenced by placing '<@' followed by a
number; using '3' would reference the file named by the third B<-f> option.
For example, if the file 'addrs' contains:

  usera@example.com
  userb@example.com

'inform' contains:

  subscribe   : all : ignore
  unsubscribe : all : ignore

and 'commands' contains:

  subscribe mylist <@1
  show mylist <@1
  configset mylist inform <@2

then the command

  mj_shell -F commands -f addrs -f inform

would do the same as the previous example.

In addition, the text parser supports the special 'default' command, which
sets some default parameter for following commands.  The 'default list'
command (followed by a list name) sets the default list, while the 'default
password' command sets the password.  Thus the 'commands' file in the
previous example can be replaced by:

  default list mylist
  subscribe <@1
  show <@1
  configset inform <@2

The default list or password can be cleared by using 'default list' or
'default password' with no list or password.

=head2 The configedit command

There is one command which is exclusive to B<mj_shell>, the B<configedit>
command.  This enables a list owner to retrieve the values of one or more
configuration variables, modify them in an editor, and save the new values
in a single operation.

Note that the configedit command is not supported on all platforms, but can
be emulated by the following set of operations:

  mj_shell -p pass configshow list vars > tempfile
  (edit tempfile)
  mj_shell -p pass -F tempfile

=head2 Switches

Here are all of the command line switches that B<mj_shell> takes:

=over 4

=item B<-D>

Specifies that full debugging information will be sent to standard output.

=item B<-d> I<domain>

Specifies the domain of lists to operate on.  The default domain is chosen
at install time; for installations supporting more than one domain, this
switch must be used to distinguish between them.

=item B<-F> I<filename>

Specifies that the text parser will be run on I<filename>.  All non-option
arguments on the B<mj_shell> command line will be ignored.

=item B<-f> I<filename>

Specifies that the contents of I<filename> will be used either as a
multiline argument for a given command, or for an external argument for a
'<@' specifier in the text parser.

More than one B<-f> argument is permitted, though multiple instances are
only used by the text parser.

I<filename> can also be the string '-', in which case standard input is
read.

=item B<-p> I<password>

Specifies a password that a command will be run with, or the default
password for commands run by the text parser.

=item B<-t> I<directory>

This specifies the directory which is the top level of the Majordomo lists
directory structure.  This is generally compiled in at installation time,
but some sites may have different directory structures.

=item B<-u> I<user>

Specifies the user that commands will run as.  Note that this does not
change the system UID, but only affects the user (really the email address)
that is passed to the Majordomo core for access checking and which is used
as the default for certain commands.  Normally the user is determined from
a combination of environment variables and the result of the 'hostname'
function, but this information is not always accurate.

Please note that this can be used for nefarious purposes, but that it does
not pose any additional security risk since mail sent to the email
processor can be trivially forged.  List owners are strongly urged not to
rely on users and email addresses for security, but instead to rely on
passwords and to enable confirmation on all security sensitive commands.

=item B<-Z>

Specifies that UID/GID tests will not be done.  Normally B<mj_shell> will
check to make sure that it is running as the user and group specified
during installation.  Failure of this test generally indicates an
installation error; either the wrappers or the scripts themselves shouldf
be installed setuid and setgid to the Majordomo user and group.  Using the
B<-Z> option enables B<mj_shell> to run even with this misconfiguration,
though other operations may fail and file ownerships will not be set
correctly.

This option is mainly used by the test scripts, so that they can run before
the software has been completely installed.

=item B<--id>

Forces B<mj_shell> to print out the real and effective user and group IDs
at the beginning of execution.  Used for debugging.
