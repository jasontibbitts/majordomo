This file contains examples of how you would solve certain problems.  The
answers are probably not complete; in many cases Mj2 is so flexible that
there are many ways to solve the problem.


Problem:
  How to have a list with 30 members but allow posting by 300 addresses and
  nobody else?

Solution 1:
  Sign everyone up, but put the people who don't want to get anything in the
  class 'nomail'.  (set blah-list nomail address@host.dom).  This means the
  people who can post are real subscribers; they just don't get any
  messages.  Set restrict_post appropriately:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  END

  to close off posting to the list.


Solution 2 (most like Majordomo 1):
  Sign up the recipient users and put everyone else in a sublist:

  auxadd blah-list posters address@host.dom
         `-list    `-sublist

  then restrict posting to the main list and that sublist:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  posters
  END


Solution 3 (most flexible):
  Sign up the recipient users, put everyone else in a sublist, make a file
  explaining that only members can post, 'put' it with the name
  'membersonly', and make an access rule:

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny, mailfile=membersonly
  !@MAIN && !@posters
  END

  This rule denies all postings from users who are not in the main list and
  are not in the 'posters' sublist.  They will be sent the named denial
  message if they try to post.

  The 'deny' can be changed to 'consult' to let the list owner approve the
  messages if desired, as with the other two solutions.
