This file contains examples of how you would solve certain problems.  The
answers are probably not complete; in many cases Mj2 is so flexible that
there are many ways to solve the problem.

Problem:
-------
  How to have a list with 30 members but allow posting by 300 addresses and
  nobody else?

Solution 1:
  Sign everyone up, but put the people who don't want to get anything in the
  class 'nomail'.  (set blah-list nomail address@host.dom).  This means the
  people who can post are real subscribers; they just don't get any
  messages.  Set restrict_post appropriately:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  END

  to close off posting to the list.


Solution 2 (most like Majordomo 1):
  Sign up the recipient users and put everyone else in a sublist:

  auxadd blah-list posters address@host.dom
         `-list    `-sublist

  then restrict posting to the main list and that sublist:

  restrict_post <<END
  blah-list
  posters
  END


Solution 3 (most flexible):
  Sign up the recipient users, put everyone else in a sublist, make a file
  explaining that only members can post, 'put' it with the name
  'membersonly', and make an access rule:

  access_rules <<END
  post
  deny, mailfile=membersonly
  !@MAIN && !@posters
  END

  This rule denies all postings from users who are not in the main list and
  are not in the 'posters' sublist.  They will be sent the named denial
  message if they try to post.

  The 'deny' can be changed to 'consult' to let the list owner approve the
  messages if desired, as with the other two solutions.



Problem:
-------
  How to I stop massive crossposting between lists at my site and perhaps
  lists at other sites, too?

Solution:
  You can do this using taboo_headers matches and an access rule.

  First create and 'put' a file called 'nocrossposting' explaining how
  crossposting between your lists and between your and others are not
  allowed.

  Then put some entries into taboo_headers:

taboo_headers <<END
/^(to|cc):.*some-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*some-other-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*another-related-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*yet-another-list/i 10,crosspost
/^(to|cc):.*and-another/i 10,crosspost
END

  These look like normal taboo_headers entries, with a twist: the
  information on the end contains a 'score' (or a 'severity') and a name.
  Taboo matches can be given names; when one of them matches, the score is
  added to that name.  So for every match, ten points are added to the
  'crosspost' match.  Note that if you included your own list there, the
  match will start out at 10.

  Now, you have to test the score of the 'crosspost' match and do something
  with the message if it matches too many times.  This is done with a few
  lines in the access_rules variable:

access_rules <<END
post
deny, mailfile=nocrossposting
$taboo_crosspost >= 30
END

  This will deny the message and mail out your 'nocrossposting' file if the
  score gets to 30 or above.  If your list is not matched by any of the
  taboo_headers lines, this means that the message will be sent back to the
  poster if it is crossposted to three or more lists.  You can adjust the
  '30' to meet your needs.  You can also adjust the individual scores;
  perhaps some lists are OK to crosspost to but you still want to stamp out
  excessive crossposting, so you could give the taboo lines matching those
  lists scores of 5 or so.

  Note that because each of your lists doesn't know what comes in to your
  other lists, the poster will get several rejection notices.
