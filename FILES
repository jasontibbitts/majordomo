These are all of the files that should exist somewhere in a list's (or
GLOBAL's) filespace.  They will be variable-substituted and mailed out at
various times.  (Many customization possibilities have reduced the number
of such files.)  Note that the list's search_list will be consulted, so
GLOBAL should not contain files like faq or info (barring, of course,
applications where this is warranted).

welcome
-------

Sent out to welcome new subscribers if welcome_files is unset and welcome
is on (modulo any specific welcome setting on the subscribe request).

The following will be substituted:

$LIST      => the name of the list
$REQUEST   => the request address
$MAJORDOMO => the address of the majordomo email interface
$USER      => the user's address
$OWNER     => the list owner's address

inform
------

Sent out to the list owner to inform them of some list action (a new
subscription, etc.)

The following substiutions will be made to the subject of the message:

$UREQUEST  => the _upcased_ request (to be like 1.9x)
$REQUEST   => the request
$LIST      => the list name

The following substitutions will be made to the body:

$VICTIM    => the user who will be effected by the request
$LIST      => the list the request acted on
$REQUEST   => the request that was made
$REQUESTER => the user who made the request
$CMDLINE   => the command that was sent
$STATUS    => the status of the action (succeed, fail, stall)

intro
-----

Sent out attached to the welcome message if welcome_files is unset and
welcome is on.  No variable substitutions are done.


info
----

Sent in response to an info request.  No variable substitutions are done.


faq
---

Sent in response to a faq request.  No variable substitutions are done.


confirm, consult
----------------

Sent out to inform a user or the list owner of the confirmation token
they must return.  The following substitutions will be performed in
both the subject and body:

$VICTIM    => The user who will be acted on by the request
$REQUESTER => The user who made the request
$CMDLINE   => The command that was sent (or would have been sent were the
              command have come in via email)
$REQUEST   => The type of request that was made
$LIST      => The list the request was made to
$TOKEN     => The token that is to be returned
$URL       => The URL that can be visited to accept the token
$EXPIRE    => The number of days until the token expires
$OWNER     => The address of the list owner
$MJ        => The address Majordomo receives commands at
$MJOWNER   => The address of the owner of this Majordomo installation

ack_stall, ack_denial
---------------------

Sent out to users who request posting acknowledgments (though stalls are
not acknowleged on moderated lists) when their message is sent to the
moderator/denied/rejected.  Note that stalls and denials happen
instantaneously due to a consult or deny clause in access_rules, while
rejections happen _after_ a stall, when the moderator rejects the token.

$LIST      => The list (duh).  This is substituted both in the subject and
              the body of the message.
$MESSAGE   => The stall/denial message returned from access_rules or the
              rejection message given by the moderator when the token is
              rejected.

Note that these are only sent for posts; for other requests, this
information is communicated through the normal command reply.

ack_rejection
-------------

Sent out to users when the list owner rejects a token.

$REQUEST   => The submitted command line.
$MESSAGE   => The rejection message given by the list owner, if any.

ack_success
-----------

Sent to users who request all acknowlegements.  This should just inform
them that their message was successfuly delivered.

$LIST => The list.  Substituted in both the subject and body.

ack_timeout
-----------

Sent when a token/spooled message is deleted after expiration without being
accepted or rejected.
