If upgrading from alpha 1 or earlier, please read README.UPGRADE.

This is an alpha release of Majordomo 2.0.  It can easily be used to run a
number of lists.  Many pieces of functionality that are present in 1.94.x
(most prominent being digests) are missing from this release and there is
much work to be done.  There are definltely many bugs although all critical
bugs encountered during testing have been fixed.

Note: this requires Perl 5.004_01 to run.  This is due to bugs in
5.004, and the fact that lesser versions are both lacking in features
and security.  Most of the testing is done using Perl 5.004_04.

The following modules are required.  These may have prerequisites which
have not been listed; please inform majordomo-workers (see below) of these.

the libnet package, including Net::Domain.
the MIME-tools package (version 4.119), including MIME::Parser and
  MIME::Entity.
the MailTools package (version 1.11), including Mail::Header and
  Mail::Internet.
the TimeDate package (version 1.08), including Date::Format.
Data::Dumper version 2.07
MD5 version 1.7
MIME::Base64 version 2.0
Date::Manip version 5.1

The Time::HiRes module is recommended if you want to generate accurate
timings, but is not required.

All of these modules are available from CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network.  To find a CPAN site nearest you, look at
<URL:http://www.perl.org/> or <URL:http://www.perl.com/>.  You may also use
the CPAN module which comes with Perl; check the Perl documentation for
more info.

Majordomo 2 includes its own setuid wrapper generation, so setuid scripts
are not required.  Things are slightly simpler without them, but all
functionality is preserved.  The wrappers are compiled using the
information from the Perl configuration; if this is incorrect, then the
wrappers will not build.  You need a complete and proper Perl installation
in order to run Majordomo.

Note: if you have any input on this software, even if you have not
tested it, please let majordomo-workers@greatcircle.com know.  All
feedback is appreciated.

Reporting bugs:

Please report bugs to mj-bugs@hpc.uh.edu, or use the online reporting form
at <URL:http://www.hpc.uh.edu/cgi-bin/majordomo/wreq/req>.  These are
processed by an automated tracking facility; you will be periodically
informed of your bug report's status.

Similarities with 1.94.x:

A major design goal of Majordomo 2 is to provide something that looks
exactly like Majordomo 1.94.4 to the users.  All existing instructions for
end users of Majordomo-managed lists should still be applicable, excepting
places where changes in previous behavior were required to fix bugs or plug
security holes.  (Note that the changes in the confirmation process both
fix bugs and improve security and also make things much easier on the
users.)

The situation is much the same for list owners, but the approval and config
procedures have changed.  There is some backwards compatibility here,
though, and more may be forthcoming.  There are, of course, many more
variables that can be set.

Differences from 1.94.x:

Everything.  No code has survived.  It was flea-bitten, full of warnings
and didn't have a hope of running under -w, use strict, or taint checks.  I
found it simpler to write it all anew than to try to fix the old code and
make it do what I wanted.  I tried for a long time; half-rewriting it at
least twice.

Majordomo now communicates with a delivery agent via standard
protocols; there is no reliance on being able to call something that
looks like sendmail.  It can also speak the protocol used by
qmail-queue to inject mail directly.

Majordomo keeps a database of subscribers, and so can keep lots of extra
state information.  Because of this, digests can be incorporated into the
main list, along with vacation mode and other goodies.

Majordomo has a completely different file layout, with one directory per
virtual domain containing one directory per list.

The interfaces are completely separate from the core.  There are interfaces
for email and shell access, with plans for more.

Piles of other stuff.  Too much to list.  Read all of the pods and the TODO
list, and the hundred or so pages of notes I have on real paper which you
probably couldn't read even if you could get to them.


Installation:

Much blood has been shed to make installation as painless as possible.
It's still painful because it's not finished.  Try to imagine how easy it
will be when it's finished.

To install:
  unpack (you did that if you're reading this).  Make certain that root is
    able to read all of the distribution files.
  type "perl Makefile.PL".

Your system will be checked for prerequisite modules and such.  If any are
not found, you must install them before installation can continue.  Some
sample instructions that may work for many properly configured perl
installations are provided for missing modules.

You will be asked several questions as Majordomo configures itself for your
system.  See the 'Makefile.PL questions' section at the end of this
document for more detailed discussion on the questions that Makefile.PL
asks.

When the configuration process finishes, you will be asked to run 'make'
and 'make install'.  'make' will prepare the files for installation, and
can be done without special priviliges.  'make install' must be done as
root, as it will need permission to make directories and change ownership
of files.  You will be asked more questions; it is safe to answer yes to
all of them.  (These questions are asked to speed up the installation
process for developers who will install several versions many times.)

Finally Majordomo2 will be installed, and some configuration information
will be suggested.  Be aware that this configuration information may not be
correct for all sites; especially sites running virtual domains.  Virtual
domain users and users of other MTAs, please let us know how to confugure
things for you.


Interacting with Majordomo:

After installing the aliases as given by the installation process and
possibly rebuildig the alias database, Majordomo should respond to mailed
commands at the given address.  The command processor works in much the
same way as it does in Majordomo 1, but with many additions.  In
particular, the commahd works and also takes topics to give help on; try
'help topics' and 'help parser'.

New with Majordomo2 is the shell interface; it can be used to interact with
the server via the command line.  This is in general much easier to deal
with for local users.  The installation process will have installed a
manual page along with the executables and libraries; accessing it is
system-dependent but may require setting the MANPATH variable to add the
new directory.  Just about everything that can be done from te email
interface can be done from the shell interface, along with a few other
things like interactive editing of configuration variables.


Creating and converting lists:

You can make your own lists just by calling the creatlist command, like
this:

mj_shell -p password createlist list-name owner@address

This will give you the necessary aliases to add to the appropriate file, if
you're running Sendmail.  Note that for sites running virtual domains the
suggestions may not be completely correct and additions to other files (the
virtusertable, most likely).

You can pull in a set of addresses from a Majordomo 1.9x list like this:

mj_shell -p password -f old-list-file subscribe=quiet,noinform list-name

(This subscribes all addresses from a file, without welcoming them and
without sending an informational notification to the list owner).

If you copy the old configuration file into the directory for the new list,
it will be automatically created.


List configuration:

Lists are configured using the configshow and configset commands.  The old
config interface is not yet supported.  Try viewing the 'admin
configuration' help topic.  To see the whole config file, you can send
'configshow=comments listname ALL'.


The Filespace:

Each list has a directory where retrievable files are stored; this is
called a filespace.  Because normal filesystems do not track enough
information about file types, Majordomo2 maintains a database containing
information about these files such as their description and MIME type.  The
list owner can upload files to the filespace and users can retrieve files
from the public portion of the filespace.

When retrieving a file from the filespace, Majordomo2 consults a search
list made from the 'file_search' config variable and a global default.
Other list's files can be referenced as long as they share their files.
Since Majordomo2 goes through the filespace to send out nearly all of its
messages, this provides both an overrideable defaults mechanism and a means
for internationalization.

Files are uploaded using the 'put' command; 'put=dir' will make
directories.  There is currently no way to delete a file.  The 'newinfo',
'newintro' and 'newfaq' commands are shortcuts for 'put' with specific
arguments.

Files are retrieved with the 'get' command; 'get=immediate' will return the
file inline instead of mailing it as a separate message.  The 'intro',
'info' and 'faq' commands are shortcuts for 'get' with specific arguments.

A (partial) list of the response files that Majordomo2 uses are given, with
supported variable expansions, in the FILES document.


Archives:

Archives start accumulating as soon as the archive_dir variable is set and
the directory exists, or as soon as an "archive" directory appears in the
public area of the list's filespace.  The latter can be done by the command

  put=dir /public/archive Archives

(properly approved, of course).  There is no need to create additional
aliases.  Archives are free of fronters, footers, most header modifications
and subject prefixing.  The archive system will automatically create a
".index" directory to place various indices.

The archive directory can be a symbolic link without problems, although it
cannot be created from within Majordomo.  The usual reason for this is to
permit the archives to be in an FTP area.

(Archives will be needed in order for digests to work.  There will be
provisions for old archives to automatically be removed, in case long-term
archiving is not desired.)


Access Control:

All operations which need to restrict access go through a central mechanism
for doing so.  The list owner can choose to use the old Majordomo 1
interface which works via the *_access variables, restrict_post,
subscribe_policy and the like.  This works as expected (though the
mechanism by which restrict_post lists are set up has changed).

The owner can also choose to make use of an extremely flexible system which
is semi-documented in the 'ACCESS_RULES' file.  This, when coupled with
some of the taboo_* extensions (like severity and classes) and the metrics
that resend collects allows almost arbitrarily complex access control.

Instead of Majordomo 1's limitation of confirming only subscribes, almost
any operation can be stalled and completed after a conformation token is
returned by either the user or the owner (or both).  The owner can also
choose to deny outright a request.

Information about a token can be retrieved using the 'tokeninfo' command.


Sessions:

Majordomo2 stores information about every email or command line processed
in files called sessions.  These are files containing all pertinent
information about the session (email headers, CGI environment, selected
environment variables, etc. as appropriate) as well as a log of all
commands executed during that session.  When a token is rejected,
information about the session that generated it is automatically mailed to
the list and site owners (if they elect to receive such information).


Makefile.PL Questions:
----------------------

  What is the user ID that Majordomo will run as?
   Either the numeric ID or the user name is fine.

Majordomo must run as a specific user on your system.  Generally an account
must be created (the installation process will not do this for you).  Give
either the name of this account or its numeric ID here.

----

  What is the group ID that Majordomo will run as?
   Either the numeric ID or the group name is fine.

As above, the installation process needs to know which group Majordomo will
run in.  It is not necessary for Majordomo to be in a special group or that
a separate group be created, although some administrators may wish things
to be this way.

----

  Should the SETID wrappers be installed?
   Majordomo needs to be able to run as the proper user no matter who is
    running it.  This requires that it be installed SETID.  On some systems,
    the Majordomo programs can be installed SETID, but this requires both
    that the operating system support it ant that perl be built to support
    it.  If this is not possible, a set of tiny wrapper programs can be built
    which will take care of the SETID needs of Majordomo.
   If you're not sure of how to answer this question, just answer YES.
    There is no loss of functionality when the wrappers are enabled.  Curious
    users may want to answer NO; if wrappers are required, the installation
    process will fail later.

  Install the wrappers? 

Majordomo must run as a single user, but the mail system may execute it as
other users depending on varions curcumstances.  Also, the shell interface
must run properly no matter who executes it.  For these and other reasons,
Majordomo must run setuid.  On some systems and perl installations it
suffices to simply set the appropriate permissions on the scripts, while on
others small wrapper programs must be created and compiled.  It is
difficult for the installation process to determine the proper setting; it
is always OK to build the wrappers but things are slightly simpler without
this.

----

  What umask should Majordomo use?
   The umask is the Unix method of restricting the permissions on newly
    created files and directories.
   Useful values are:
    077 (nobody can read any Majordomo files)
    027 (users in the Majordomo group can read the files)
    007 (users in the Majordomo group can read and write the files)
   Choose 077 for maximum security.  Majordomo2 can operate with very strict
    permissions.

  What should umask be set to?

Check the umask manual pages for more information on umasks; the basics are
in the description.

----

  Where will the Majordomo libraries, executables and documentation be kept?
   This could be something like "/usr/local/majordomo"; Majordomo will make
     this directory and several directories under it to hold its various
     components.
   Note that this is not necessarily where your lists must be stored.

Majordomo just needs to know where to put its executables and libraries.
After installation, Majordomo will not write to this location.  It can be
NFS mounted or on a partition mounted read-only (after installation is
complete, of course).  If it is an NFS-mounted partition, however, that
partition must be mounted to as to allow setuid binaries.  If this is not
the case, most of Majordomo will fail completely.  Note that Majordomo does
not install its libraries into the normal perl installation directories.

----

  Where will the Majordomo list data be kept?
   Note that under this directory will be a directory for each domain your
     site supports, and under that a directory for each list at your site.
   Note also that this should _not_ be a directory containing lists
     maintained by Majordomo 1.x, as Majordomo 2 stores its lists in a
     different format.

This should _not_ be an NFS-mounted directory, as the locking mechanism
currently used by Majordomo will not funciton properly over NFS.  This
doesn't have to be in the same location as the previous directory.

----

  Where can Majordomo place temporary files?
   Majordomo occasionally needs to write out short-lived files in a place
     that all users can write to.  These files are generally small and are
     deleted after the operations are complete.

This should be something like /tmp where everybody can create files.

----

  Where can Majordomo place secure temporary files?
    Majordomo also needs to write out private temporary files.  For maximum
      security, this should be a special directory that is neither readable
      nor writable by normal users.  (In other words, it should not be /tmp
      unless you know what you're doing.)  Many security problems can arise
      when any user can create files and links in the temporary directory with
      the same names that Majordomo would use.
    The installation process will create this directory if it does not exist,
      but will not enforce any permissions.

Majordomo will create this directory during installation but will not
create it at runtime.  Therefore you should be wary of placing this on a
filesystem like Sun's tempfs which goes away after a reboot unless you take
care to recreate the directory properly during the boot process.
