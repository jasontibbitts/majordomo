	suggestions.  Fix set command bug in mj_wwwusr.  Add a "Sign Out"
	button to mj_wwwadm and mj_wwwusr, which invalidates the 
	temporary password.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  Change version number to 0.1200102140.
	(dispatch) Improve mode validation: no modes over 11 characters
	in length are allowed.
	(legal_list_name)  Make this routine a function instead of an
	object method.

	* lib/Mj/Token.pm: (del_latchkey)  New routine.  Remove a 
	latchkey from the temporary password database.

	out of the code and into the default configuration file.

2001-02-05  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_shell (privs_user, privs_mj): New functions to drop and
	regain permissions.

	Call them throughout the code where permissions were switched.

	Add permission-changing calls around all code that opens files
	specified on the command line.

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_part): Note if we skipped any garbage at
	the end of the part.
	Fix minor bug where we said "Skipped 1 lines..."
	
2001-02-02  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* t/shell.t: Copy the mj_shell script and take out the 'use lib'
	line so that the tests won't use already-installed libraries.

2001-02-01  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* Makefile.PL:  (check_nr_install) Test to see if installation
	as the majordomo user is feasible, and report any problems.

2001-01-31  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_wwwadm, bin/mj_wwwusr:  Various cosmetic changes,
	plus the ability to include "domain=example.com" in the 
	path_info part of the URL, to make aliasing the URL easier.

2001-01-30  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (sync_owners): Set the override flag so that
	majordomo-owner is never sent mail.

2001-01-29  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm: (trigger)  Allow private files from a 
	list's file space to be parsed for commands.  The files
	must be specified in the list's "triggers" configuration
	setting, with names beginning with a forward slash.
	(configdef, configset, configshow)  Support a five-level
	password approach.  The ability to see or change a setting
	is based upon the kind of password used, and upon any changes
	to the default levels in the new config_access setting.
	(_list_file_get)  Remove GLOBAL from the default file search path.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm:  (mutable, visible)  Check the config_access
	setting for access level changes.
	(intro)  Return a listref of data instead of a formatted string.
	(parse_access_array) New routine.  Parse a table that controls
	what level of password is necessary to see or change configuration

2001-01-27  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/BounceParser.pm:  (parse)  Parse addresses with
	digest volume and issue number, which takes the form DVxxxNyyy.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver.pm:  (_setup)  Use a separate envelope sender for
	each destination object.  This allows VERP probing for digest
	recipients, among other things.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm:  (do_digests)  Manufacture a sequence
	number from the volume and issue number of each digest to 
	allow VERP probing of digest recipients.

2001-01-25  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_shell:  Untaint the password.  Allow multiple
	files to be processed with the -F option.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (configdef)  Do not allow the installation
	settings, in the GLOBAL:_install and DEFAULT:_install templates,
	to be reset.
	(_createlist, _list_config_regen)  Regenerate the parsed values 
	for the GLOBAL:_install and DEFAULT:_install templates.
	(_list_sync_owners)  New routine.  Assess the old and new owners
	settings and update the GLOBAL:owners sublist accordingly.
	(sync_owners)  Use the "groups" field in the SubscriberList
	to store a list of mailing lists owned by a particular address

	* lib/mj_cf_defs.pl:  Use a substitution hash to set configured
	values; this will correct the quoting problems noted by
	Peter Ajamian.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm:  (isparsed) Addresses are not parsed
	by DEFAULT lists.  This allows "$LIST" substitutions to
	be applicable to each list using the defaults individually.
	(_defaults)  Removed.  _load_dfl is used to load
	all default values from configuration files.
	(parse_address)  Retrieve the "whereami" value with get()
	instead of always using the installation settings.
	(regen)  New routine.  Reconstruct the parsed configuration
	data from the raw configuration data, and save the result
	in the configuration file.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver.pm:  (deliver) Access address lists directly.
	Mj::SubscriberList and Mj::RegList, as well as a list of 
	addresses can be used.  This routine is now used to deliver
	all mail that Majordomo sends.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (new)  Include the domain in the data stored
	by the List object.  Adjust SubscriberList instantiation arguments
	to allow future backend enhancements.
	(config_regen)  New routine.  Wrapper for Mj::Config::regen.
	(update)  New routine.  Offer a generic way to replace the
	data for an existing subscriber database entry.

	* lib/Mj/MailOut.pm:  (mail_message, deliver, probe)  Call
	Mj::Deliver::deliver using a revised set of arguments.  This
	allows the Mj::Deliver and related modules to be detached
	from Mj::List, eventually to allow asynchronous delivery.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm:  (post_start)  Add support for the addhdr
	command mode, which treats the here args as a (plain text) message 
	body, and generates the necessary headers.
	(_add_headers)  New routine.  Add From, To, Subject, Date,
	Message-Id, and Content-type headers.

	* lib/Mj/SubscriberList.pm:  Rename the "rewritefrom" field to
	"groups."  This field is used by the GLOBAL:owners sublist
	to store a list of supported lists.

	* setup/setup_func.pl:  (do_default_config)  Create 
	DEFAULT:_install and GLOBAL:_install configuration files.
	mj_cf_defs.pl is no longer used directly by Majordomo.
	(install_config_templates)  Do not reveal the domain password
	during installation.

2001-01-20  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (p_expire)  Remove old data from the
	parser database, using the session_lifetime setting for
	the cutoff age.

2001-01-18  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (_archive)  Add support for summary mode,
	which lists the archives available and the number of bytes,
	lines, and messages in each archive.  
	(archive_chunk) Change the default behavior
	of the "archive-get" command:  mail the messages individually,
	unless "digest" mode is also specified.
	(_createlist) Add missing MIME::Entity declaration.  Noted
	by Marc Fournier.
	The version number is now 0.1200101180

	* lib/Mj/Access.pm:  (_a_default)  Add password-only access
	settings to the *_access and *_policy configuration settings.
	_access settings can include open+password or list+password,
	and _policy settings can include open+password or auto+password.

	* lib/Mj/Archive.pm:  (summary)  New routine. Return the message, 
	byte, and line count of each archive file.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (archive_get_to_file, archive_summary) 
	New routines.  Wrappers for Mj::Archive::{get_to_file,summary}.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver/Envelope.pm:  (new)  Allow an empty envelope
	sender.  Suggested by Rudolph T Maceyko.

2001-01-12  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_queuerun:  (parse_commands)  Record data for messages
	which contain no valid commands.  After a threshold is reached,
	send the results to the domain owner instead of replying to
	the originator.  This will prevent an autoresponder mail loop
	with Majordomo if the message contains no valid commands.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (record_parser_data, _make_parser_data)  
	Store a record containing the date and count of commands issued by a 
	particular address.  At the moment, this is only used to
	restrict autoresponder loops.
	(_subscribe, _unsubscribe)  Do not alter the registry when
	an address is subscribed to or unsubscribed from an auxiliary 
	list.
	(_unregister)  Log/inform for each of the individual unsubs.

	* setup/setup_func.pl:  (install_config_templates)  Run the
	Majordomo commands in the setup/config_commands file.  These
	commands currently establish the DEFAULT:personal template,
	which causes a separate copy of a posted message to be sent
	to each recipient of a mailing list.  The recipient's address
	is contained in the To: header, and a message footer with
	unsubscription instructions is added.

2001-01-05  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (announce) Add support for sending
	announcements to auxiliary lists.
	(_who) Add "owners" command mode, which displays the list
	owner addresses and the lists they administrate.  
	(sync_owners) New routine.  The GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list 
	is automatically updated to contain all of the owners' addresses, 
	including the deletion of addresses that are no longer owners.
	This routine is called by the "createlist-regen" command, by
	the "who-owners" command, and whenever the owners setting for
	a mailing list is changed.

2000-12-20  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Format.pm:  (archive) Use format files for the archive
	command, which is supported by the text and wwwadm interfaces.

2000-12-19  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_confirm:  Rewrite to use format files, have instructions,
	and be easier to navigate.

	* lib/Mj/Format.pm:  (who) Use hard-coded formatting for the
	plain who command for better speed.  The who-enhanced and who-bounces
	commands will be 5 to 10 times slower for large lists due to the 
	formatting substitutions.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (_make_fs)  Cease using the filedir setting.

2000-12-17  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm: (parse_part)  Inform about "parse" failure if
	no valid commands were found.

2000-12-16  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (standard_subs) Add CONFIRM_URL, WWWADM_URL
	and WWWUSR_URL variables to the standard substitutions.  These
	give the values from the GLOBAL configuration settings of the
	same names (wwwadm_url and wwwusr_url are new settings).
	(help_start)  Use "help overview" as the default help page;
	"help help" instead displays a summary of the help command.
	(_faq, _info, _intro)  Allow LASTCHANGE substitution to be used
	to supply the date on which the document was last modified.

2000-12-13  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Actually call
	handle_bounce_removal to delete users.
	(handle_bounce_removal): Delete users only when -noprobe is
	specified.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_access_rules, parse_bounce_rules):
	Accept '-' separating actions from modes in addition to '='.

2000-12-12  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/mj_cf_defs.pl: Now that reply_do and subject_prefix default
	to nonempty values, default_flags should not include replyto or
	prefix.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_removal): New function:
	handle deleting of users or constructing tokens to do so.

2000-12-11  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (trigger): Expire additional bounce data as
	well.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Trim accidental debug
	statement.  Properly deal with excessive counts.  Unshift data
	into new list unstead of pushing it, so that order is preserved.
	
	(expire_bounce_data): New function: expire old data from _bounce
	database.

2000-12-11  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	even if we got no bounce data.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: "subscribed" variable is valid in
	bounce_rules.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (_gen_bounce_message): New function to
	generate the bounce report message.
	(handle_bounce_message): Don't ignore warnings; let bounce_rules
	decide that.  If handle_bounce_user doesn't return a message,
	assume that the owner doesn't want to be informed about the
	bounce.
	(handle_bounce_user): Rewrite.  Pay some atttention to
	bounce_rules; don't generate a report if the owner doesn't want to
	be informed.  Generate a short report for bounces to
	majordomo-owner.  Since bounce_add can handle it, add bounce data
	even for not-subscribed addresses.

2000-12-10  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (bounce_add): Take hash instead of lots of
	arguments.
	(_make_bounce): New function; create the simple bounce database.
	(bounce_add): If user is not subscribed, add bounce data to a
	separate database.
	(bounce_get): If no subscriber data was found, look in the bounce
	database.

2000-12-09  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* t/core.t: Add even more tests.  Now tests all of the core calls
	that shell.t does, plus a few other things.

	* lib/Mj/Addr.pm (_validate): Completely ignored case of two @
	signs outside of comments.

	* t/addr.t: Add tests for two @ signs outside of comments.

2000-12-08  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm: (_unsubscribe) Add "farewell" mode, which
	causes the farewell file to be mailed to each address that
	is removed from the list.

2000-12-08  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (_list_config_set): When addr_xforms changes,
	store the new value in the address parser.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (set): Return the parsed data, if there is any,
	on a successful set.

2000-12-07  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: Make %actions the hash of all supported
	actions along with their parameters.  Make %generic_actions a hash
	of the actions supported by most commands.  Replace %actions with
	%generic_actions in {access}{actions} portion of command
	descriptions.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Fix oops in bounce
	percentage display.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm (_within_limits): 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (describe_class): 
	* lib/Mj/Format.pm (digest):
	Import time_to_str from Mj::Util and call it instead of
	List::_time_to_str.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (_report): 
	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_part): 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (make_setting): 
	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_limits): 
	* lib/Mj/Archive.pm (expand_range): 
	* lib/Mj/Access.pm (_a_delay):
	Import str_to_time from Mj::Util and call it instead of
	List::_str_to_time.

	* lib/Mj/Util.pm: Add str_to_time, time_to_str, and
	_str_to_time_dm, and export the first two.
	(process_rule): Call str_to_time instead of
	Mj::List::_str_to_time.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm: Remove _str_to_time, _str_to_time_dm, and
	_time_to_str.

2000-12-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (dispatch)  Alter mode checking to
	give an error instead of silently ignoring invalid punctuation.
	(_createlist)  Convert the aliases setting from flags to
	enumerated format if necessary.

	* lib/Mj/Access.pm:  (list_access_check)  The data used to 
	check time constraints on access rules are now a list
	of lists rather than a scalar value.  Treat the master_password
	variable as an integer instead of a boolean value.  This
	allows administrative passwords to be differentiated by type.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm:  (handle_bounce_message, 
	handle_bounce_token)  Use the first owner's address as the 
	envelope sender to avoid loops if the majordomo-owner address
	malfunctions.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm:  (get)  Return a scalar value if a
	supposed listref is not a reference.
	(parse_flags)  Remove unused routine.
	(_compile_rule)  Revise time constraints to use a 2d listref.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (set)  Revise handling of flags to
	convert configuration settings automatically from the old, 
	abbreviated format to the new, enumerated format.  The
	allowed_flags setting now treats each flag individually,
	instead of grouping ack and hide flags.
	(get_flags)  Convert an enumerated list of flags into a
	a string of abbreviations.  Replaces the default_flags routine.

	* lib/Mj/MTAConfig.pm:  (add_alias)  Use the new, enumerated
	format of the aliases setting.

	* lib/Mj/MailOut.pm:  (owner_done)  Use the first owner's
	address as the envelope sender when forwarding mail to
	the majordomo-owner address.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm:  (_post)  Use the Date header for the 
	date in the DATE substitution.

	* lib/Mj/Util.pm:  (process_rule)  Treat the "current" time
	spec checks as a list of lists.  Revise the "args" hash to
	allow reasons and delays to be passed back to the calling routine.

2000-12-07  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Remove rule
	processing and call Mj::Util::process_rule instead.

	* lib/Mj/Util.pm (process_rule): Accept and deal with $current.
	Export process_rule.

	* lib/Mj/Access.pm (list_access_check): Remove rule processing and
	call Mj::Util::process_rule instead.

2000-12-06  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: Remove bounce actions from %actions;
	they were in there only by mistake.

2000-12-05  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	* t/bounce.t: Make sure we process the tests in numerical order.

2000-12-05  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm: %args needs to be local so it can be
	shared with the compartment during bounce_rules processing.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_bounce_rules): Fix off by one error in
	rule IDs.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (bounce_gen_stats): Always generate all
	statistics.  

	Computation of consecutive bounce count was badly busted.
	
	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_bounce_rules): The default action is
	'inform', not 'ignore'.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Import
	'action_terminal' from Mj::CommandProps.

	Since all stats are always generated, don't include some messages
	about statistics when they are meaningless.

	Enable the bounce_rules checking code; include the result in the
	report but don't actually do anything with is.
	
	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: 'remove' is a terminal action.

2000-12-04  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_message): Completely
	ignore warning bounces.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: Revise actions for bounce_rules.

2000-12-04  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	* setup/ask_domain.pl (ask_domain): Make it clear that the
	expected answer to "What is the email address of the
	owner of this Majordomo installation" is not "majordomo-owner".

2000-12-03  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Bug fix: when all
	bounces expired, all were kept.

2000-12-02  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (dispatch):  Add simple command mode validation.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (search):  Allow a count of results desired.

2000-12-01  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/MTAConfig.pm (add_alias): Fix bug in VUT owner-list
	entry.

	* lib/Mj/BounceParser.pm (parse_smtp32): Fix possible infloop.

2000-11-25  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* setup/newdomain.pl:  Allow domains to be added
	to the installation using the "make domain" shell command.

2000-11-22  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

2000-11-18  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* README.CALLING:  Somewhat outdated file describing the 
	request hash calling conventions.

	* bin/mj_shell:  Add editing support for the get-edit
	command, which wraps a file in a put command, to allow
	easy editing and replacement using your favorite editor.

	* bin/mj_wwwadm, bin/mj_wwwusr:  Rewrite.  Move all formatting
	into Mj::Format.  List explicitly the supported commands.

	* files/en/error/*:  New error files.  Allow customization
	of error messages (only two are used at present).

	* files/en/format/*:  New format files.  Allow customization
	of command output (only commands that require special
	formatting in the WWW interfaces are included at present,
	such as the configshow, lists, and show commands.)

	* files/en/help/configset_*:  Change "Variable Groups" heading
	to "Category" and revise the categories used.

	* files/en/help/configshow:  Document "categories" mode, 
	including a list of all ten categories.

	* files/en/help/get:  Document "edit" mode, which wraps a
	file with a put command, to allow easy editing and replacement.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (dispatch) Improve list validation.
	(standard_subs) Add DOMAIN and PWLENGTH substitutions.
	(substitute_vars_format)  New routine.  Allows more extensive
	line-based formatting, with the following new features:
	  $HELP:LOZENGE   add a hypertext link to the "lozenge" help file
	  ?COMMENT        skip this line if the COMMENT substitution is empty.
	Also, if a substitution value is a list reference, the formatting
	of lines in which the variable appears will be spread over multiple
	lines, one for each array element.  For example, in the lists command,
	the DESCRIPTION substitution is a list reference.  As a result,
	the following line in the format file:
	  $LIST:-23 $DESCRIPTION
	will cause the list name to be displayed only on the first line,
	while the description may span several lines, all indented.
	(format_error) New routine.  Retrieve an error file and apply
	substitutions to it.  Return the result in a string.
	(format_get_string) New routine.  Obtain a format file as a string.
	(_get) Add support for the edit command mode.
	(help_start) Allow abbreviations of configset_ topics.  For example,
	  help configset_who_access
	can be abbreviated to
	  help who_access

	lists) and group sizes to be used.
	(t_expire) Expire latchkeys (temporary passwords).

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  Remove the 'auth' variable from the
	request hash, and make the 'interface' variable specific

	and list_access_check by 2.

2000-07-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_args):  Deal with attachments.  If a command
