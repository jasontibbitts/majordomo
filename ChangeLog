	command form and introduction from mj_wwwadm to separate files
	to allow easier customization.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm, lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_args):
	Split variable names in the configdef and configshow commands

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (make_setting):  Allow nomail-return to
	work for vacations that are not timed.

	the Deliver module to distribute messages to addresses
	in the registry.
	(announce) New command.  Distribute a file to one
	or more classes of subscribers.  Each message is
	sent as a probe, with the recipient in the To: header.
	This could be used for periodic reminders, or 
	announcements that need to reach 'digest' and 'nomail'
	subscribers immediately.
	(archive_chunk) Allow the type of digest for the
	archive-get command to be specified in the mode ("-mime"
	for mime; text otherwise.)

	variable, which is set if there is only one recipient.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver/Envelope.pm:  (new, address, send)

	* lib/Majordomo.pm: (dispatch) Inform on post_done, but not
	on post_start.

2000-07-28  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm:  Use "auxlist" instead of "sublist."
	The argument names must be alphabetical in relation to the
	order in which the arguments appear on the command line.
	Using "auxlist" allows more flexibility in choosing names
	for the other arguments.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm, lib/Mj/Format.pm:  Combine code for
	the who and auxwho commands.
 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Expire auxiliary

	  -x SUBLIST    Post a message to an auxiliary list.
	At present, qmail support does not include auxiliary lists.
	The -moderator alias follows the same conventions as the
	-owner alias.  The auxiliary list aliases follow the same
	conventions as the resend (main list) alias.
	(Thanks to Brock Rozen for suggesting the -(un)subscribe aliases.)
      
	* bin/mj_queuerun: Handle altered queue file names for new aliases.
	The file names will end with a comma, followed by an auxiliary
	list name or command name or 'M' (for -moderator).
	Remove the unused qmail code.

	* bin/mj_wwwadm, bin/mj_wwwusr: Add support for latchkeys.

	(dispatch)  Convert a latchkey into a permanent password.
	(gen_cmdline) Take into consideration messages posted to

	the "who-enhanced" command.
	(reject) For consult tokens, indicate whether or not the
	victim was informed.
	(set) Indicate the sublist if "aux" mode is used.
	(tokeninfo) Indicate the number of approvals required.
  
	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  Cease using AddressList.pm.  Auxiliary
	lists now use the SubscriberList module.
	(set, make_setting) Allow settings to be changed for 
	auxiliary lists.  Digest mode is not supported for sublists.
	Ensure that digest names are converted to lower case.
	(aux_add) Extend the data to accommodate the fields of

	in decreasing order of precedence.
	(_make_aux) Use SubscriberList instead of AddressList
	(validate_aux) New subroutine. Initialize an auxiliary list if it
	already exists.

	lib/Mj/MTAConfig.pm: (add_alias) Allow the use of optional
	(moderator, subscribe, unsubscribe, and auxiliary list) aliases.
	(regen_aliases) Sort the lists alphabetically.

	lib/Mj/MailOut.pm: (deliver) Add the sublist to the argument list.
	(owner_done) Direct the message to the moderators instead of
	the owner, if required.

	lib/Mj/Resend.pm: (post, _post) Allow messages to be posted
	to auxiliary lists.  Add 'sublist' to the access variables.
	Do not increase the sequence number, archive the message,
	or issue digests if the message is posted to a sublist.

	lib/Mj/Token.pm: (consult) Allow moderator groups (auxiliary
	lists) and group sizes to be used.
	(t_expire) Expire latchkeys (temporary passwords).
	(_make_latchkeydb, gen_latchkey, validate_latchkey) New subroutines.
	Latchkeys are temporary passwords used by the WWW interfaces

	* bin/mj_wwwadm:  Add hypertext links to help pages.
	(Thanks to Sudhakar Chandrasekharan for the suggestion.)

2000-07-16  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/TextOutput.pm:  Remove entirely.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  Remove the 'auth' variable from the
	request hash, and make the 'interface' variable specific
	to each session, rather than to each request.  This reduces
	the number of arguments to routines like global_config_get
	and list_access_check by 2.

2000-07-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_args):   Deal with attachments.  If a command 
	accepts here arguments and is iterated,  set the appropriate request
	variable to the attachment file handle.  Otherwise, read
	the data from the file handle into the argument array.
	(Only the post and put commands will use the file handle.)

	routines for the showtokens, tokeninfo, and who commands.

	(faq_start, info_start, intro_start) Remove temporary files.
	(createlist) Use "newlist" variable instead of "list."
	(sessioninfo) Rename to sessioninfo_start.  Treat
	sessioninfo as an iterated core routine.

	particular command.  Include the size of the spool
	file in the output for posted messages.

2000-06-27  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	Use new core function calling conventions.
