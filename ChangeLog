	This allows the archive-delete-hidden command to be used to 
	clean "hidden" messages from the archive using a trigger.
	(_set)  Bugfix:  do not send a partial digest of messages
	if no messages are scheduled for delivery.  Also, use

	Add support for the noarchive_body and noarchive_headers
	configuration settings.

	* lib/Mj/Digest.pm:  (sync)  New routine.  Replace the
	state data for one or more digests.  This is used to update
	the digest data after the archives have been changed by
	the archive-delete or archive-sync command.

	each digest, extract the current information from the
	archives, and update the digest information.
	(should_ack)  Test the validity of the address.
	Thanks to Ron Kuris.

	* lib/Mj/MIMEParser.pm:  (collect_data)  Mark a message as
	"hidden" if it has an "x-no-archive: yes" or 
	"restrict: no-external-archive" header.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm:  (_post)  Add support for "hidden" messages,
	which occur when:  (1) the "hide" command mode is used;
	(2) the "hidepost" flag is set; or (3) when the message matches
	one of the patterns in the noarchive_body and noarchive_headers
	settings.  Add an "X-No-Archive: yes" header to every hidden
	message, in both the archived and the distributed copy.
	(_check_approval)  Log/inform a rejection of a token
	using the "Approved" feature.
	(_check_poster)  Add support for the hide_post access variable,

	request section, not the majordomo section.
	
	* bin/mj_email, bin/mj_queuerun:  Differentiate the
	"email," "email-request," and "email-command" interfaces.

	used if a blank message is sent to a command alias, such
	as LIST-subscribe.

	* bin/mj_shell:  Bugfix:  Work around Net::Domain bareword
	problem by invoking "use strict" after external modules

	possibly the requester, instead of domain owners.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm:  Support the report-full and

	settings to the *_access and *_policy configuration settings.
	_access settings can include open+password or list+password,
	and _policy settings can include open+password or auto+password.

	sender.  Suggested by Rudolph T Maceyko.

2001-01-12  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_queuerun:  (parse_commands)  Record data for messages
	which contain no valid commands.  After a threshold is reached,
	send the results to the domain owner instead of replying to
	the originator.  This will prevent an autoresponder mail loop
	with Majordomo if the message contains no valid commands.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (record_parser_data, _make_parser_data)  
	Store a record containing the date and count of commands issued by a 
	particular address.  At the moment, this is only used to
	restrict autoresponder loops.
	(_subscribe, _unsubscribe)  Do not alter the registry when
	an address is subscribed to or unsubscribed from an auxiliary 
	list.
	(_unregister)  Log/inform for each of the individual unsubs.

	* setup/setup_func.pl:  (install_config_templates)  Run the
	Majordomo commands in the setup/config_commands file.  These
	commands currently establish the DEFAULT:personal template,
	which causes a separate copy of a posted message to be sent
	to each recipient of a mailing list.  The recipient's address
	is contained in the To: header, and a message footer with
	unsubscription instructions is added.

2001-01-05  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (announce) Add support for sending
	announcements to auxiliary lists.
	(_who) Add "owners" command mode, which displays the list
	owner addresses and the lists they administrate.  
	(sync_owners) New routine.  The GLOBAL:owners auxiliary list 
	is automatically updated to contain all of the owners' addresses, 
	including the deletion of addresses that are no longer owners.
	This routine is called by the "createlist-regen" command, by
	the "who-owners" command, and whenever the owners setting for
	a mailing list is changed.

2000-12-20  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Format.pm:  (archive) Use format files for the archive
	command, which is supported by the text and wwwadm interfaces.

2000-12-19  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* bin/mj_confirm:  Rewrite to use format files, have instructions,
	and be easier to navigate.

	* lib/Mj/Format.pm:  (who) Use hard-coded formatting for the
	plain who command for better speed.  The who-enhanced and who-bounces
	commands will be 5 to 10 times slower for large lists due to the 
	formatting substitutions.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (_make_fs)  Cease using the filedir setting.

2000-12-17  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser: (parse_part)  Inform about "parse" failure if
	no valid commands were found.

2000-12-16  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (standard_subs) Add CONFIRM_URL, WWWADM_URL
	and WWWUSR_URL variables to the standard substitutions.  These
	give the values from the GLOBAL configuration settings of the
	same names (wwwadm_url and wwwusr_url are new settings).
	(help_start)  Use "help overview" as the default help page;
	"help help" instead displays a summary of the help command.
	(_faq, _info, _intro)  Allow LASTCHANGE substitution to be used
	to supply the date on which the document was last modified.

2000-12-13  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Actually call
	handle_bounce_removal to delete users.
	(handle_bounce_removal): Delete users only when -noprobe is
	specified.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_access_rules, parse_bounce_rules):
	Accept '-' separating actions from modes in addition to '='.

2000-12-12  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/mj_cf_defs.pl: Now that reply_do and subject_prefix default
	to nonempty values, default_flags should not include replyto or
	prefix.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_removal): New function:
	handle deleting of users or constructing tokens to do so.

2000-12-11  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (trigger): Expire additional bounce data as
	well.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Trim accidental debug
	statement.  Properly deal with excessive counts.  Unshift data
	into new list unstead of pushing it, so that order is preserved.
	
	(expire_bounce_data): New function: expire old data from _bounce
	database.

2000-12-11  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	even if we got no bounce data.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: "subscribed" variable is valid in
	bounce_rules.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (_gen_bounce_message): New function to
	generate the bounce report message.
	(handle_bounce_message): Don't ignore warnings; let bounce_rules
	decide that.  If handle_bounce_user doesn't return a message,
	assume that the owner doesn't want to be informed about the
	bounce.
	(handle_bounce_user): Rewrite.  Pay some atttention to
	bounce_rules; don't generate a report if the owner doesn't want to
	be informed.  Generate a short report for bounces to
	majordomo-owner.  Since bounce_add can handle it, add bounce data
	even for not-subscribed addresses.

2000-12-10  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (bounce_add): Take hash instead of lots of
	arguments.
	(_make_bounce): New function; create the simple bounce database.
	(bounce_add): If user is not subscribed, add bounce data to a
	separate database.
	(bounce_get): If no subscriber data was found, look in the bounce
	database.

2000-12-09  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* t/core.t: Add even more tests.  Now tests all of the core calls
	that shell.t does, plus a few other things.

	* lib/Mj/Addr.pm (_validate): Completely ignored case of two @
	signs outside of comments.

	* t/addr.t: Add tests for two @ signs outside of comments.

2000-12-08  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm: (_unsubscribe) Add "farewell" mode, which
	causes the farewell file to be mailed to each address that
	is removed from the list.

2000-12-08  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (_list_config_set): When addr_xforms changes,
	store the new value in the address parser.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (set): Return the parsed data, if there is any,
	on a successful set.

2000-12-07  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: Make %actions the hash of all supported
	actions along with their parameters.  Make %generic_actions a hash
	of the actions supported by most commands.  Replace %actions with
	%generic_actions in {access}{actions} portion of command
	descriptions.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Fix oops in bounce
	percentage display.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm (_within_limits): 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (describe_class): 
	* lib/Mj/Format.pm (digest):
	Import time_to_str from Mj::Util and call it instead of
	List::_time_to_str.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (_report): 
	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_part): 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (make_setting): 
	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_limits): 
	* lib/Mj/Archive.pm (expand_range): 
	* lib/Mj/Access.pm (_a_delay):
	Import str_to_time from Mj::Util and call it instead of
	List::_str_to_time.

	* lib/Mj/Util.pm: Add str_to_time, time_to_str, and
	_str_to_time_dm, and export the first two.
	(process_rule): Call str_to_time instead of
	Mj::List::_str_to_time.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm: Remove _str_to_time, _str_to_time_dm, and
	_time_to_str.

2000-12-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (dispatch)  Alter mode checking to
	give an error instead of silently ignoring invalid punctuation.
	(_createlist)  Convert the aliases setting from flags to
	enumerated format if necessary.

	* lib/Mj/Access.pm:  (list_access_check)  The data used to 
	check time constraints on access rules are now a list
	of lists rather than a scalar value.   Treat the master_password
	variable as an integer instead of a boolean value.  This
	allows administrative passwords to be differentiated by type.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm:  (handle_bounce_message, 
	handle_bounce_token)  Use the first owner's address as the 
	envelope sender to avoid loops if the majordomo-owner address
	malfunctions.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm:  (get)  Return a scalar value if a
	supposed listref is not a reference.
	(parse_flags)  Remove unused routine.
	(_compile_rule)  Revise time constraints to use a 2d listref.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  (set)  Revise handling of flags to
	convert configuration settings automatically from the old, 
	abbreviated format to the new, enumerated format.  The
	allowed_flags setting now treats each flag individually,
	instead of grouping ack and hide flags.
	(get_flags)  Convert an enumerated list of flags into a
	a string of abbreviations.  Replaces the default_flags routine.

	* lib/Mj/MTAConfig.pm:  (add_alias)  Use the new, enumerated
	format of the aliases setting.

	* lib/Mj/MailOut.pm:  (owner_done)  Use the first owner's
	address as the envelope sender when forwarding mail to
	the majordomo-owner address.

	* lib/Mj/Resend.pm:  (_post)  Use the Date header for the 
	date in the DATE substitution.

	* lib/Mj/Util.pm:  (process_rule)  Treat the "current" time
	spec checks as a list of lists.  Revise the "args" hash to
	allow reasons and delays to be passed back to the calling routine.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Remove rule
	processing and call Mj::Util::process_rule instead.

2000-12-05  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm: %args needs to be local so it can be
	shared with the compartment during bounce_rules processing.

	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_bounce_rules): Fix off by one error in
	rule IDs.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (bounce_gen_stats): Always generate all
	statistics.  

	Computation of consecutive bounce count was badly busted.
	
	* lib/Mj/Config.pm (parse_bounce_rules): The default action is
	'inform', not 'ignore'.

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_user): Import
	'action_terminal' from Mj::CommandProps.

	Since all stats are always generated, don't include some messages
	about statistics when they are meaningless.

	Enable the bounce_rules checking code; include the result in the
	report but don't actually do anything with is.
	
	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: 'remove' is a terminal action.

2000-12-04  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/BounceHandler.pm (handle_bounce_message): Completely
	ignore warning bounces.

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm: Revise actions for bounce_rules.

2000-12-04  Jason L Tibbitts III  <tibbs@math.uh.edu>

	owner of this Majordomo installation" is not "majordomo-owner".

2000-12-03  Jason Tibbitts  <tibbs@morpheus.math.uh.edu>

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Bug fix: when all
	bounces expired, all were kept.

2000-12-02  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (dispatch):  Add simple command mode validation.

	* lib/Mj/List.pm (search):  Allow a count of results desired.

	command, which wraps a file in a put command, to allow
	easy editing and replacement using your favorite editor.

	* bin/mj_wwwadm, bin/mj_wwwusr:  Rewrite.  Move all formatting
	into Mj::Format.  List explicitly the supported commands.

	* files/en/error/*:  New error files.  Allow customization
	of error messages (only two are used at present).

	* files/en/format/*:  New format files.  Allow customization
	of command output (only commands that require special
	formatting in the WWW interfaces are included at present,

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (dispatch) Improve list validation.
	(standard_subs) Add DOMAIN and PWLENGTH substitutions.
	(substitute_vars_format)  New routine.  Allows more extensive
	line-based formatting, with the following new features:
	  $HELP:LOZENGE   add a hypertext link to the "lozenge" help file
	  ?COMMENT        skip this line if the COMMENT substitution is empty.
	Also, if a substitution value is a list reference, the formatting
	of lines in which the variable appears will be spread over multiple
	lines, one for each array element.  For example, in the lists command,
	the DESCRIPTION substitution is a list reference.  As a result,
	the following line in the format file:
	  $LIST:-23 $DESCRIPTION
	will cause the list name to be displayed only on the first line,
	while the description may span several lines, all indented.
	(format_error) New routine.  Retrieve an error file and apply
	substitutions to it.  Return the result in a string.
	(format_get_string) New routine.  Obtain a format file as a string.

	posts database.
	(post_add, get_post_data, expire_post_data): Call _make_post_data.

	separate debug log.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm (which): List::search now takes the sublist (or
	MAIN) as the first arg.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  (connect)  Do not validate addresses
	for requests from the resend and owner interfaces.
	(dispatch) Simplify processing requests with multiple victims.

	  $OWNER:48  would pad the list owner address out to 48 characters
	and right-justify it.
	(list_config_get, list_config_set, list_config_set_to_default)
	Support the storage of configuration templates on a per-list

	without the use of a password.
	(list_config_set)  Support "append" mode, which combines arrays
	of configuration settings.

	templates to be accessed without changing the call arguments.
	(lists) Use "full" mode to display supplemental data such
	as digest names, subscriber count, and list addresses.
	Add "config" mode to list configuration templates.  The

	differentiate log entries according to the result.

	* lib/Mj/Access.pm:  (list_access_check) Make the name of
	the interface available to the access rules.

	the Deliver module to distribute messages to addresses
	in the registry.
	(announce) New command.  Distribute a file to one
	or more classes of subscribers.  Each message is
	sent as a probe, with the recipient in the To: header.
	This could be used for periodic reminders, or 
	announcements that need to reach 'digest' and 'nomail'
	subscribers immediately.
	(archive_chunk) Allow the type of digest for the
	archive-get command to be specified in the mode ("-mime"
	for mime; text otherwise.)

	list when Majordomo::get_all_lists is run.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver.pm:  (deliver) Support delivery to 
	addresses in the registry.  Addresses subscribed to 
	at least one list are in the "each" class.  Addresses

	variable, which is set if there is only one recipient.

	* lib/Mj/Deliver/Envelope.pm:  (new, address, send)

2000-07-28  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm:  Use "auxlist" instead of "sublist."
	The argument names must be alphabetical in relation to the
	order in which the arguments appear on the command line.
	Using "auxlist" allows more flexibility in choosing names
	for the other arguments.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm, lib/Mj/Format.pm:  Combine code for
	the who and auxwho commands.
 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Expire auxiliary

	At present, qmail support does not include auxiliary lists.
	The -moderator alias follows the same conventions as the
	-owner alias.  The auxiliary list aliases follow the same
	conventions as the resend (main list) alias.
	(Thanks to Brock Rozen for suggesting the -(un)subscribe aliases.)

	* bin/mj_queuerun: Handle altered queue file names for new aliases.
	The file names will end with a comma, followed by an auxiliary
	list name or command name or 'M' (for -moderator).
	Remove the unused qmail code.

	* bin/mj_wwwadm, bin/mj_wwwusr: Add support for latchkeys.

	victim was informed.
	(set) Indicate the sublist if "aux" mode is used.
	(tokeninfo) Indicate the number of approvals required.
  
	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  Cease using AddressList.pm.  Auxiliary
	lists now use the SubscriberList module.

	auxiliary lists.  Digest mode is not supported for sublists.
	Ensure that digest names are converted to lower case.
	(aux_add) Extend the data to accommodate the fields of

	already exists.

	lib/Mj/MTAConfig.pm: (add_alias) Allow the use of optional
	(moderator, subscribe, unsubscribe, and auxiliary list) aliases.
	(regen_aliases) Sort the lists alphabetically.

	lib/Mj/MailOut.pm: (deliver) Add the sublist to the argument list.
	(owner_done) Direct the message to the moderators instead of
	the owner, if required.

	lib/Mj/Resend.pm: (post, _post) Allow messages to be posted
	to auxiliary lists.  Add 'sublist' to the access variables.
	Do not increase the sequence number, archive the message,
	or issue digests if the message is posted to a sublist.

	lib/Mj/Token.pm: (consult) Allow moderator groups (auxiliary
	lists) and group sizes to be used.
	(t_expire) Expire latchkeys (temporary passwords).
	(_make_latchkeydb, gen_latchkey, validate_latchkey) New subroutines.

2000-07-16  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/TextOutput.pm:  Remove entirely.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  Remove the 'auth' variable from the
	request hash, and make the 'interface' variable specific
	to each session, rather than to each request.  This reduces
	the number of arguments to routines like global_config_get
	and list_access_check by 2.

2000-07-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_args):   Deal with attachments.  If a command 
	accepts here arguments and is iterated,  set the appropriate request
	variable to the attachment file handle.  Otherwise, read
	the data from the file handle into the argument array.
	(Only the post and put commands will use the file handle.)

	particular command.  Include the size of the spool
	file in the output for posted messages.

2000-06-27  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>
