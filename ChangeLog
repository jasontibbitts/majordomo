	in the registry.
	(announce) New command.  Distribute a file to one
	or more classes of subscribers.  Each message is

	* lib/Mj/CommandProps.pm:  Use "auxlist" instead of "sublist."
	The argument names must be alphabetical in relation to the
	order in which the arguments appear on the command line.

	for the other arguments.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm, lib/Mj/Format.pm:  Combine code for
	the who and auxwho commands.
 
	* lib/Mj/List.pm (expire_subscriber_data): Expire auxiliary

	The -moderator alias follows the same conventions as the
	-owner alias.  The auxiliary list aliases follow the same
	conventions as the resend (main list) alias.
	(Thanks to Brock Rozen for suggesting the -(un)subscribe aliases.)
      
	* bin/mj_queuerun: Handle altered queue file names for new aliases.
	The file names will end with a comma, followed by an auxiliary
	list name or command name or 'M' (for -moderator).

	victim was informed.
	(set) Indicate the sublist if "aux" mode is used.
	(tokeninfo) Indicate the number of approvals required.
  
	* lib/Mj/List.pm:  Cease using AddressList.pm.  Auxiliary
	lists now use the SubscriberList module.

	the owner, if required.

	lib/Mj/Resend.pm: (post, _post) Allow messages to be posted
	to auxiliary lists.  Add 'sublist' to the access variables.
	Do not increase the sequence number, archive the message,
	or issue digests if the message is posted to a sublist.

	lib/Mj/Token.pm: (consult) Allow moderator groups (auxiliary
	lists) and group sizes to be used.
	(t_expire) Expire latchkeys (temporary passwords).
	(_make_latchkeydb, gen_latchkey, validate_latchkey) New subroutines.

	* lib/Majordomo.pm:  Remove the 'auth' variable from the
	request hash, and make the 'interface' variable specific
	to each session, rather than to each request.  This reduces

	and list_access_check by 2.

2000-07-07  Michael Yount <csf@moscow.com>

	* lib/Mj/Parser.pm (parse_args):   Deal with attachments.  If a command
