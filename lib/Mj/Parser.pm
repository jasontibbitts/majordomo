Mj::Parser - routines for parsing commands from files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains code for parsing commands from a filehandle and for
parsing the files out of a MIME entity.

=head2 parse_entity

This takes apart a MIME entity and parses each text/plain piece in turn.
It returns a list of entities.  This gets called recursively on each
sub-entity (if there are any) and is expected that after the recursion has
ended it will return the full list of entities parsed.

This has a tough problem to solve.  If seen in this stage, non-text parts
are ignored.  However, commands within a part may refer to other parts that
fall after it.  These parts can be of any type, and the part parser must
have access to them.  However, we must also be sensitive to horrible
mailers that might add an extra part before the message.

Currently, we''re less sensitive to mailers that add an extra part after the
main part but before any of the attachments.  The solution to this would be
to allow the attachments to be named instead of referred to by number.

=head2 parse_part

The main parser.  This expects two already open IO handles, one for input
and one for output, and an arrayref containing handles open on each of the
parts attached to this part.  The input filehandle is expected to be
connected to the body of a message.  The output can go anywhere, but the
idea is that it eventually gets mailed to the user.

In addition, this takes a ref to an array containing filehandles open on
each of the attachments to the part, if there are any.

This also takes a title, which is just some kind of text description of
what we''re parsing, the name of the interface that called us, and a ref to
a hash containing additional data (currently reply_to, password, deflist,
and token).
