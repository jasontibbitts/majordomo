=head1 NAME

Mj::BounceParser.pm - Functions for taking apart bounce messages.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of routines for parsing bounces.

MTAs whose bounces are parsed:
  Any which properly support DSNs.
  Exim
  Qmail (and Yahoo)
  Postfix
  MS Exchange
  Classic Sendmail
  Compuserve
  Lotus
  Post.Office
  SoftSwitch
  Netscape Mail Server's broken DSNs
  SMTP32

MTAs whose bounces aren't parsed:
  Mercury
  SLMail
  Bigfoot TOE mail
  EMWAC SMTPRS

These are all doable (though not easy), but rare enough that the difficulty
currently outweighs the benefit.  If you're getting a lot of them, let me
know or implement a parser yourself.

MTAs whose bounces aren't boing to be parsed:
  MMDF (who came up with these bounces?)
  Any broken enough to not bother including any mention of the recipient
   address.

package Mj::BounceParser;

$VERSION = "0.0";
use strict;

=head2 parse

Takes an eneity and tries to determine whether or not it's a bounce.  If
so, it also tries to get as much useful information about the bounce as
posible.

Takes:

  A parsed entity containing the potential bounce message.
  The list name.
  The MTA's sender separator, for parsing the To: header.

Returns:

  type - type of message this was identified to be, as a single letter (M
    for list message, T for confirmation token, etc.)
  msgno   - the message number of the bouncing message, if known
  address - address (if any) extracted from an envelope VERP.
  data    - a hashref of data, one key per user

We are supposed to give enough information to the calling layer so that it
can make a reasonable decision about what to do with the bounce.

If we can get a message number, pass it back.  There can only be one per
bounce, so that covers it.  If we could parse the bounce message to get
info, we need to communicate that.  Otherwise, we could only find the
address from the munged envelope and so the upper level needs to start
probing this address every run for some time.

If we can obtain disposition information (warning, failure, etc.) by
parsing a bounce, we must return it.  Otherwise the calling layer won't
know if we're just seeing warnings that it should just ignore.

A bounce can contain information about multiple addresses.  We have to pass
information about all of them.  This is more common than it may seem at
first.  The dispositions might not be the same for all addresses.

So we must return information gleaned from the envelope (message number,
poster) along with information from the parsed bounce, if any.

Technically, if there is no message number in the envelope then the message
is not a bounce.  Modulo really broken MTAs out there, of course.

A bounce could be in response to a post or to something like a confirmation
message.  For a post, the type will be M and a message number will be
included.  Other information will be present for other kinds of bounces.

Envelope types currently in use:

  T - token notification
  V - victim notification (for consult tokens)
  D - delay tokens
  M - messages.  May take several forms:
      M26 - message 26
      M26=user=host - message 26, user@host
  DV - digests
      DV20N3 - volume 20 number 3
      DV20N3=user=host - volume 20 number 2, user@host

Attempt to identify an RFC1894 DSN, as sent by Sendmail and Zmailer.

Returns:

  a flag; if true, we found a bounce of the appropriate format.  This does
  not mean that we have any bouncing address, only that there's no reason
  to check other formats.

The passed $data hashref is modified to contain data on each user found in
the bounce (including the status (faulure, warning, etc.) and any
user-readable diagnostic information present.  Note that this has may
contain users that are not actually subscribed, or could even contain
gueses at the bouncing address obtained by applying heuristics.  Don't
assume that every address returned here will be a subscriber to any list.

=head2 parse_exchange

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by Microsoft Exchange Server.  These
bounces don't contain much useful information, but we try to get what we
acan.  It happens very often that the extracted address has little to do
with the actual recipient.

The subject of these bounces always starts with "Undeliverable:", so we use
that to descriminate.

The bounce itself may be in a single part, a multipart with the bounce
message attached, or in some multipart/alternative brokenness.  We try to
parse all three by opening the first text part we can find.

Then we have to parse the body, which contains information on teh bounced
message, followed by:

did not reach the following recipient(s):

Amanda_Weissert@roy-talman.com on Thu, 6 Jan 2000 14:26:09 -0600
    The recipient name is not recognized

followed by something understandable only to Exchange.

=head2 parse_exim

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by the Exim MTA.  These bounces come
from Mailer-Daemon and look like the following:

This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.

A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its
recipients. The following address(es) failed:

  asdfasd@lists.math.uh.edu:
    unknown local-part "asdfasd" in domain "lists.math.uh.edu"
    Another line of diagnostics, just to make it difficult.
  hurl@lists.math.uh.edu:
    unknown local-part "hurl" in domain "lists.math.uh.edu"

------ This is a copy of the message, including all the headers. ------

followed by the entire message.

The indentation is important.  Two spaces = address possibly followed by
colon.  Four spaces = diagnostic.

Failure is indicated by the string "could not be delivered"; a warning has
"has not yet been delivered".  Warnings also have a different in-body
format, having addresses indented by two spaces, not followed by a colon
and with no following diagnostic.

Exim also conveniently includes an X-Failed-Recipients: header.  We still
want to parse the body to extract a diagnostic, but it is possible that
someone will install a custom bounce format so we use the header as a
fallback.

=head2 parse_postfix

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by Postfix.

The message is multipart, with the first part being text/plain and having a
content-description of 'Notification'.  The identifying line is:

A warning is indicated by the presense of the string "THIS IS A WARNING
ONLY".

Bouncing addresses are located at the end, and look like

<xxxx@yyyy.org>: unknown user: "xxxx"

=head2 parse_postoffice

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by Post.Office (v3.5.3 tested).  These
bounces are multipart; the first part looks like this:


This Message was undeliverable due to the following reason:

Your message was not delivered because the DNS records for the
destination computer could not be found.  Carefully check that
the address was spelled correctly, and try sending it again if
there were any mistakes.

It is also possible that a network problem caused this situation,
so if you are sure the address is correct you might want to try to
send it again.  If the problem continues, contact your friendly
system administrator.

     Host yyyy.uk not found

The following recipients did not receive this message:

     <xxxx@yyyy.uk>

Please reply to Postmaster@site-2.jet.uk
if you feel this message to be in error.

Post.Office bounces are chatty and this makes it tough to get just a simple
diagnostic.  What we try to do is pull out the first sentence of the first
paragraph of the diagnostic and all of the users.  The diag is after the
"This message was undeliverable" line and the users are after the "The
following recipients" line.

It also seems that some versions of Post.Office do not include the "the
following recipients" line, and some include extra junk on the lines
containing the addresses.  We try to cope.

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by qmail, and also by yahoo (which is
possibly running a modified qmail).  These bounces look like this:

Hi. This is (site specific text)
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<xxxx@yyyy.com>:

Yahoo messages instead look like:

Message from  yahoo.com.
Unable to deliver message to the following address(es).

<xxxx@yahoo.com>:
User is over the quota.  You can try again later.
Line 2 of response

We read until we get to:

One address per line follows until the next blank line.

After the users are extracted, we call check_dsn_diags to make use of
the logic there for pulling diagnostics out of the SMTP transaction.

Attempts to parse the bounces issued by an MTA I've never heard of called
SMTP32.

It identifies itself by an X-Mailer header:

X-Mailer: <SMTP32 v991129>

The only thing we care about is the first line of the bounce, which looks
something like:

User mailbox exceeds allowed size: xxxx@yyyy.net

=head2 parse_softswitch

"Delivery Report (failure)", bounces are single-part and body has:

Your message was not delivered to   xxxx@yyyy.es

=head2 check_dsn_diags

Does extra parsing for bounces where we could extract bouncing addresses
but didn't get useful diagnostics.  This includes DSNs not including the
optional diagnostic-code-field and those who include the field but include
a string like "250 OK" or "250 Message accepted for delivery" instead of
something useful.

These MTAs mostly seem to be some version of Sendmail, and all seem to
include some useful data at the end of the human-readable portion of the
DSN, in a block that looks like:

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to XXXX.net.:
>>> RCPT To:<yyyy@XXXX.NET>
<<< 553 <yyyy@XXXX.NET>... Users mailbox is currently disabled
550 <yyyy@XXXX.NET>... User unknown

We look for lines like:

<<< 553 <yyyy@XXXX.NET>... Users mailbox is currently disabled
550 <yyyy@XXXX.NET>... User unknown
550 yyyy@XXXX.NET... User unknown

and we also look for bare user names.  These are matched against the users
that DSN parsing found but couldn't extract diagnostic information for.

This function returns truth if any useful diagnostic was found.

=head2 check_dsn_netscape

Does extra parsing for bounces that come from some versions of Netscape
Messaging Server (4.15 and 4.03, at least).  These look just like DSNs but
don't contain any per-user delivery status blocks (making them illegal
according to RFC1894.  The DSN parser will call us explicitly when it sees
that it needs to.

Also, some servers to include a per-user block but don't include any useful
diagnostics and don't include a session transcript the way Sendmail does.

To parse it, we have to plow through the human-readable portion to find
users and diagnostics.  But note that this idiotic software uses different
bounce formats when it recognizes different SMTP errors, so we have to
parse a bunch of different kinds of bounces.  Here are the things we look
for:

1) Lines like the following:

User quota exceeded: SMTP <xxxx@yyyy.net>

We match with (.*): [sl]mtp <(.*)>.

2) A block like

    Recipient: <xxxx@yyyy.net>
    Reason:    <xxxx@yyyy.net>... Relaying denied

We match against /^\s*recipient:\s*<(.*)>\s*$/i, and then pull in the
following line.

3) A block with the diagnostic first, like:

     DNS for host yyyy.net is mis-configured
The following recipients did not receive this message:
     <xxxx@yyyy.net>

We keep the previous lines around (dumping them when we see a blank) and
when we hit the appropriate line we know to save away the diagnostics and
pull out addresses until the next blank.

4) A variant of the first, without as much identifying information:

User quota exceeded: xxxx@yyyy.com

Parsed with /^([^:]+):\s+(.*)\s*$/

5) A variant of #3:

This Message was undeliverable due to the following reason:

The following destination addresses were unknown (please check
the addresses and re-mail the message):

SMTP <xxxx@yyyy.net>
