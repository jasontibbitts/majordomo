=head1 NAME

Mj::Deliver::Sorter - Address list sorting object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that takes addresses, optionally sorts them, and passes
them to an Mj::Deliver::Dest for delivery when it''s destroyed.

=cut

package Mj::Deliver::Sorter;
use Mj::Log;
use Mj::Deliver::Dest;

=head2 new(arghash, nosort)

This creates a sorter object.  If nosort is true, the data will not be
sorted but its size will be computed anyway.

=cut
sub new {
  my $type   = shift;
  my $class  = ref($type) || $type;
  my $data   = shift;
  my $nosort = shift;
  my $log    = new Log::In 150;

  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;

  $self->{'data'}   = $data;
  $self->{'nosort'} = $nosort;
  $self->{'addrs'}  = [];
  $self;
}

sub DESTROY {
  my $self = shift;
  my $log  = new Log::In 150;
  $self->flush;
}

=head2 add

This adds an address and domain to the object.

=cut
sub add {
  my $self  = shift;
  my $addr  = shift;
  my $dom   = shift; # Actually the canonical address
#  my $log   = new Log::In 150, "$addr, $dom";

  # Extract that domain from the canonical address
  $dom =~ s/.*@//;

  # Stuff the address and reversed domain for safe keeping.  We reverse the
  # domain because it saves time in sorting (we only reverse once) and the
  # order doesn't matter for exact string comparisons.
  push @{$self->{'addrs'}}, [$addr, lc scalar reverse $dom ];
}

=head2 flush

This actualy performs the sorting (if desired), allocates an
Mj::Deliver::Dest, and runs the sorted (and sized) list through it.

=cut
sub flush {
  my $self = shift;
  my $log  = new Log::In 150;
  my($dest);

  unless ($self->{'nosort'}) {
    $self->{'addrs'} = [ sort  { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] } @{$self->{'addrs'}} ];
  }

  $self->{'data'}{'total'} = scalar(@{$self->{'addrs'}});
#  print "Allocating Dest\n";
  $dest = Mj::Deliver::Dest->new($self->{'data'});
#  print "Allocated Dest\n";
  
  for (my $i=0; $i < @{$self->{'addrs'}}; $i++) {
    $dest->add(@{$self->{'addrs'}[$i]});
  }
  $self->{'addrs'} = [];

  # Rely on destruction to flush $dest
  1;
}
