=head1 NAME

Mj::Deliver::QQEnvelope - Implement an Envelope on top of qmail

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that is call compatible with the Envlope object.  It
consists of a sender, recipients and a message.  When the envelope is sent
it uses the qmail-queue program to inject the message into the local mail
system.

Thanks to Ryan Tadlock for this code.

=head2 new

This builds an Envelope.  You must call it with at least 'sender' so that
it can begin the transaction.

Arguments:

  sender  - the address to show in the From_ line.  Bounces will go here.
  file    - the file containing the message text (headers and body) to send
  addrs   - a listref containing the addresses to send to

Sender has no default.  You can specify a file and add addresses later.

=cut

sub new {
  my $type  = shift;
  my $class = ref($type) || $type;  
  my %args  = @_;
  my $log   = new Log::In 150;
  my($addfile);
  
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;
  $addfile = POSIX::tmpnam;
  $self->{'addname'} = $addfile;

  # This isn't really neccessary but I want to maintain call compatibility
  # with the Envelope object.
  unless (defined $args{'sender'}) {
    $log->abort("Must provide a sender when opening an envelope");  
  }

  $self->{'sender'} = $args{'sender'};

  if (defined $args{'file'}) {
    $self->file($args{'file'});
  }
  
  $args{'addresses'} ||= $args{'addrs'};
  if (defined $args{'addresses'}) {
    $self->address($args{'addresses'});
  }
  
  $self;
}

=head2 file(filename)

Sets the filename that will be sent as part of the envelope.

=cut

sub file {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->{'file'} = shift;
};

sub sender {
  my $self = shift;
  my $log  = new Log::In 150;

  $self->{'sender'} = shift;

  # make the address file now using name concocted in new
  $self->{'addfile'} = new IO::File ">$self->{'addname'}";
  unless (defined $self->{'addfile'}) {
      $log->abort("Unable to open tempfile $self->{'addname'}");
  }
  $self->{'addfile'}->print("F" , $self->{'sender'} , "\00");
}

=head2 address(scalar or listref)

Adds addresses to the envelope.  Returns true if some addresses were accepted.

=cut

sub address {
  my $self = shift;
  my $addr = shift;
  my($good, $i);
  
  $good = 0;
  
  unless (ref $addr) {
    $addr = [$addr];
  }
  
  # Unlike SMTP, we don't have to worry about addresses being rejected
  # here, so we're OK if we add even one address.
  for $i (@{$addr}) {
    $good = 1;
    $self->{'addfile'}->print("T" , $i , "\00") ;
  }
  
  $self->{'addressed'} = 1 if $good;
  return $good;
};

=head2 send

This sends the Envelope on its way by attaching the data from the file.
This will abort (i.e. terminate the running program) if the Envelope has
not yet been addressed, if a file has not been specified or if the file is
in some way unreadable.

=cut

sub send {
  my $self = shift;
  my $log  = new Log::In 150;
  my ($pid, $fd1, $fd2, $addfile);
  
  $log->abort("Sending unaddressed envelope") unless $self->{'addressed'};
  $log->abort("Sending empty envelope")       unless $self->{'file'};
  $self->{'addfile'}->print( "\00");
  $self->{'addfile'}->close()
    or $::log->abort("Unable to close file $self->{'addname'}: $!");

  if ($pid = fork()) {
    waitpid $pid,0;
    unlink $self->{'addname'};
  } 
  elsif (defined $pid) {
    close STDIN;
    close STDOUT;
    $fd1 = POSIX::open ($self->{'file'});
    $fd2 = POSIX::open ($self->{'addname'});
    unless (($fd1 == 0) && ($fd2 == 1) ) {
      $log->abort("Unable to produce proper file descriptors");
    }
    $ENV{PATH} = "/bin:/usr/bin:/var/qmail/bin/";
    exec "qmail-queue";
  }
  else {
    # The fork failed so I will abort
    $log->abort("Unable to fork");
  }
  1;
}

=head2 DESTROY

This is the method to clean up for the object.  It currently just removes
any temp files left behind.

=cut

sub DESTROY {
  my $self = shift;
  
  if (defined $self->{'addname'}) {
    if ( -e $self->{'addname'}){
      unlink $self->{'addname'} ;
    }
  }
  1;
}
