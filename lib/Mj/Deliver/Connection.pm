=head1 NAME

Mj::Deliver::Connection - Low level connection object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Connection is a thin layer above a network socket.  It exists to allow
the possibility of communicating with something other than a socket using
the same interface.  An earlier version of this code supported executing a
program with the Connection object encapsulating its input and output.

This class also encapsulates a simple buffered IO mechanism over unbuffered
sysread and syswrite.  This enables us to use select calls to provide real
timeouts on socket reads.  (The buffered writes are still used, right now.)

=head2 new(host, port, timeout)

A simple constructor.  Right now we only bother to implement connections
via sockets; connections to programs are very useful, but more difficult to
implement.  This opens the connection, sets the output handle to autoflush
node, and returns.

=cut
sub new {
  my $type  = shift;
  my $class = ref($type) || $type;
  my ($proto, $sock, $sin, $iaddr, $tmp);

  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;

  $self->{'host'}      = shift;
  $self->{'port'}      = shift || 25;
  $self->{'timeout'}   = shift || 60;
  $proto = getprotobyname('tcp');

  $sock = gensym();
  $tmp = socket($sock, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto);
  unless ($tmp) {
    warn $@ if $@;
    return;
  }

  $iaddr = inet_aton($self->{'host'});
  unless ($iaddr) {
    warn $@ if $@;
    return;
  }

  $sin = sockaddr_in($self->{'port'}, $iaddr);
  unless ($sin) {
    warn $@ if $@;
    return;
  }

  # Autoflush the socket
  $tmp = select;
  select $sock;
  $| = 1;  
  select $tmp;

  $tmp = connect ($sock, $sin);
  unless ($tmp) {
    warn $@ if $@;
    return;
  }

  $self->{'outhandle'} = $sock;
  $self->{'buffer'} = '';

  return $self;
}

=head2 print(string)

This outputs a string to the connection.

=cut
sub print {
  my $self   = shift;
  my $string = shift;
  my ($win, $ein);

  $win = '';
  vec($win, fileno($self->{'outhandle'}), 1) = 1;
  $ein = $win;

  return unless (select(undef, $win, $ein, $self->{'timeout'}) > 0);
  print {$self->{'outhandle'}} $string;
}

=head2 getline

This grabs a line from the connection, timing out (and returning undef)
appropriately.  If tomult is specified, it linearly scales the timeout.

Because select and getline (and buffered input in general) don''t mix, we
maintain our own buffer and read a chunk off of the socket whenever it is
necessary.

There was support for a separate input handle, but the support for
communicating with a pair of filehandles has been scrapped.  (That was the
original reason for this module, but...)

=cut
sub getline {
  my $self = shift;
  my $tomult = shift;
  my ($len, $ein, $fhn, $rin, $eout, $rout);
  $tomult = 1 unless (defined($tomult) and length($tomult));

  $fhn = fileno($self->{'outhandle'});
  $rin = '';
  vec($rin, $fhn, 1) = 1;
  $ein = $rin;

  while(!length($self->{buffer}) || $self->{buffer} !~ /\n/) {
    return unless (select($rout=$rin, undef, $eout=$ein, 
                   $self->{'timeout'}*$tomult) > 0);
    # Check that we didn't encounter an error on the filehandle
    if (vec($eout, $fhn, 1)) {
      warn "Error reading from MTA";
      return;
    }
    $len = sysread($self->{'outhandle'}, $self->{'buffer'}, 1024,
				       length($self->{'buffer'}));
    return undef unless $len;
  }
  $self->{'buffer'} =~ s/^([^\n]*\n)//;
  $1;
}

=head2 fileno

This returns the filenumber of the input side of the connection, for use in
building a select vector.

=cut
# sub fileno {
  # my $self = shift;
  # my $handle = $self->{'inhandle'} || $self->{'outhandle'};
  # $handle->fileno;
# }

=head2 input_pending

Select on the handle to see if it has something waiting to process.  Useful
for building a simple polling routine.

=cut
# sub input_pending {
  # my $self = shift;
  # return $self->{'outsel'}->can_read(0);
# }
