=head1 NAME

Mj::Deliver::Prober - Bounce probing object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that takes addresses, generates an appropriate sender
from them, and passes them an Mj::Deliver::Dest for delivery.

=cut

package Mj::Deliver::Prober;
use Mj::Log;
use Mj::Deliver::Dest;
use Bf::Sender;

=head2 new(arghash)

This creates a prober object.

=cut
sub new {
  my $type  = shift;
  my $class = ref($type) || $type;
  my $data  = shift;
  my $file  = shift;
  my $snum  = shift;
  my $sep   = shift;
  my $log   = new Log::In 150, "$data->{sender}, $snum, $sep";

  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;

  $self->{'data'}    = $data;
  $self->{'dest'}    = Mj::Deliver::Dest->new($self->{'data'}, $file, 'single');
  $self->{'seqnum'}  = $snum;
  $self->{'sendsep'} = $sep;
  $self->{'addrs'} = [];
  $self;
}

sub DESTROY {
  1;
}

=head2 add

This adds an address and domain to the object.

=cut
sub add {
  my $self  = shift;
  my $addr  = shift;
  my $canon = shift;
#  my $log   = new Log::In 150, "$addr, $dom";

  # Generate an appropriate sender; we use the canonical address because
  # it's always shorter and it is the actual key to the database, making
  # the lookup quicker later.
  my $sender =
    Bf::Sender::M_probe_sender($self->{data}{sender},
			       $self->{sendsep},
			       $self->{seqnum},
			       $canon,
			      );

  # Set the dest's sender
  $self->{'dest'}->sender($sender);

  # Add the addr to the Dest.
  $self->{'dest'}->add($addr, $canon);

  # Flush the dest.  (It will flush anyway, and we want it to happen now to
  # keep things simple because we're playing around with the sender.)
  $self->{'dest'}->flush;
}

=head2 flush

This is a noop.  We don''t ever keep any unflushed addresses around.

=cut
sub flush {
  1;
}
