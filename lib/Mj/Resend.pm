=head1 NAME

Mj::Resend - filtering and transformation functions for Majordomo

___NNNOOOTTT FINISHED!!!___

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $mj->resend($list, $file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This performs two important functions: filtering (including MIME
transformation), and delivery.  Incoming messages are filtered by checking
headers and body against various regular expressions.  Then the message is
decomposed into MIME parts and the various parts are transformed, decoded,
saved, and deleted according to a configuration table.  Messages which fail
the various filters are sent of for approval.  The transformed versions of
messages which pass are delivered to the various recipients who receive
each message.  The message is also passed on for archiving and
digestifying.

Future cool things to investigate include: users who do not receive
their own messages.  (I implemented everything else on my list.)

Order of operation:

 Pull in message, parse into MIME entities and header [1]
 Check for approval.
 Apply admin_headers and taboo_headers.
 Apply admin_body to first n lines of first text part.
 Apply taboo_body to all text parts.  (What is a text part?)
 Find "illegal" MIME parts.
 *** Bounce now if necessary ***
 Strip out approvals to get the real article; parse it if necessary
 Make two copies of the entity
 Convert or drop MIME parts for list and archive/digest
 Strip unwanted headers from list, archive/digest.
 Add headers, fronter and footer [3] to outgoing copy.
 Compose final message.
 Deliver.
 Deposit in archive.

1. MIME parsing automatically handles QP and base64 decoding (and
   some other weird ones, like x-gzip64).

2. There are six supported approval methods.  Briefly:
     Approved: in the header
     Single-part messages:
       Approved: as first non-blank line of the body, followed by a
         blank line and the body.
       Approved: as first non-blank line of the body, followed by a
         complete message including headers and body.
     Multipart messages:
       Approved: as first non-blank line of the preamble.
       Approved: as first non-blank of first body part.
       Approved: as first non-blank line of the first body part of a
         multipart message with exactly two parts, the second of which
         is of ty0e message/rfc822 and contains the complete message
         to be sent to the list.
   There is also the post command, which allows out-of-band approval,
   and the normal token-based approval method.

3. Fronter and footer get separate MIME parts when configured to do so, and
   always for Multipart messages.  This is to prevent non-MIME messages
   from being gratuitously turned into MIME messages.  Non-MIME messages
   will not generally be hurt by adding fronters and footers right into the
   body, but this should be configurable.  The mangling of true MIME
   messages should not be allowed to occur.

Note that the bodyhandles get opened and closed and things are copied
more than once in some cases.  This is inefficient, but is also
conceptually easy to deal with and relatively easy to maintain and
extend.  Eventually this should all be restructured to recurse down
the MIME tree once, doing what ever is required, and to open the body
exactly once, doing all the copying and checksumming that is required.

=head2 post_start, post_chunk, post_done

These provide an iterative interface to the post function, so that it can
be used from the command interfaces and from a network source.

There is no access checking here, because that happens once the
to-be-posted message is parsed.  It may be useful to place some
restrictions here, because it makes forging messages even more trivial,
since the message doesn''t actually have to pass through the mail system.
Hmmm.

=head2 _check_approval(list, head, entity, user)

This takes a ref to a MIME::Entity and checks to see if it is approved by
one of several methods:

 *In header 
 *First line of preamble
  First line of first part
  First line of body
  First line of first part followed by a message/rfc822 attachment.
  

Head should be a copy of the message header, already decoded and unfolded.

Return flag, password, token. 

The password is validated and the token unspooled if they are given.

Note that this routine doesn''t do any processing on the message;
specifically, it does not remove any Approved: lines or extract any
embedded messages.  This is done in teh bottom half of the post
function.

The first sum is done over the first (checksum_lines) lines, the second
over the entire body.

for signatures)?

matching code from the parsed attachment_rules variable.  We always

reason and set an appropriate variable.

=head2 _trim_approved

This removes Approved: pseudo-headers from the body of the message.

If present in the preamble, it is removed.

If present in the first line of the body of the message and followed
immediately by a blank line, it and the blank line are removed by
creating a new body copying all but the new body into it.

If present in the first line of the body and not followed immediately
by a blank line, everything directly after the Aproved: line is parsed
as a new MIME entity and the old entity is completely obliterated.

If the message is multipart, the first body part is checked for the
header, and it is removed if present.

If the message is multipart, consists of exactly two parts, the first
part contains nothing but the Approved: line and the second part has
type message/rfc822, then the second part is parsed as a MIME message
and the original entity is completely obliterated.

This returns an entity and a head; they may be the same, they may be
different.

Note that Approved: headers are removed along with the rest of the
skip headers after this step is complete.

XXX Perhaps call this function recursively?  Are there situations
where many approvals can be stacked up?

XXX Need to purge all of the bodies and entities that we get rid of in
the course of this function.

multipart or the only part is not text/plain, then we have to do
things via attachments.  For a first pass, we will only deal with
multipart messages or text/plain single-part messages; trying to
convert a single-part message into a multipart one just to attach some
goodies is not a really good idea (and might never happen).  We need
to decide if we really want to add a fronter or footer, figure out
which one to use, then attach it.
