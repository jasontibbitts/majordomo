=head1 NAME

Mj::BounceHandler.pm - Functions for dealing with bounces

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of routines for dealing with bounces.  This includes calling the
bounce parser, dealing with the data returned, locating bouncing users and
removing them if necessary.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 handle_bounce

Look for and deal with bounces in an entity.  All of the bounce processing
machinery is rooted here.

The given file is parsed into a MIME entity

=cut

use Mj::BounceParser;

  my ($self, $list, $file) = @_;

  $parser->output_prefix("mjo");

  $fh->close;

  # Extract information from the envelope, if any, and parse the bounce.
  $whoami = $self->_global_config_get('whoami');
  $whoami =~ s/\@.*$//;
  $source = 'unknown@anonymous';

=head2 handle_bounce_message

Deal with a bouncing message.  This involves figuring out what address is
bouncing and if it's on the list, then running the bounce_rules code to
figure out what to do about it.

  }
  $lsender  = $self->_list_config_get($list, 'sender');

  # If we have an address or subscriber ID from the envelope, we can only
  # have one and we know it's correct.  First we have to get from that to
  # the actual user email address.  Parsing may have been able to extract a
  # status and diagnostic, so grab them then overwrite the data hash with a
  # new one containing just that user.  The idea is to ignore any addresses
  # that parsing extracted but aren't relevant.
  if ($user) {

    # Get back to the real email address; loop up subscriber ID if we have
    # one.

    if ($data->{$user}) {

=head2 handle_bounce_token

Deal with a bouncing token.  This involves simply deleting the token, since
it didn't get where it was going.

=head2 handle_bounce_user

Does the bounce processing for a single user.  This involves:

*) adding new bounce data

*) generating statistics

*) deciding what action (if any) to take

*) logging the bounce

*) return an explanation message block to the caller

=head2 handle_bounce_removal

Deal with the particulars of removing a bouncing user.

There are several possibilities:

1) Remove the user immediately.

2) Generate a bounce probe; if it bounces, remove the user.

3) #2, but consult the owner before removing.

#1 is easy; just call the core unsubscribe routine.

#2 is more difficult; we construct the message and send it with a special
sender.  We also generate a token.  When a bounce is seen with the special
sender, the token is accepted (instead of being deleted, which is the
normal action for bouncing tokens).

#3 involves the same as #2, except that the token is generate with chain
#fields indicating a consult token is to be generated upon its acceptance.
