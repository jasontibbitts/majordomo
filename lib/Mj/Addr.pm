=head1 NAME

Mj::Addr - address manipulation functions for Majordomo

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $av = new Mj::Addr(%params)
 ($ok, $strip, $comment) = $av->validate($address);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small module for checking the validity of addresses and
separating the mailbox and the comment portions from them.  It is placed in
the form of a module so that various parameters can be set for all
validations without setting global variables.

use Mj::Log;

=head2 new

This allocates an address validator object.  This is made an object so that
certain configuration values can be assigned to it without using package
globals.

The following parameters can be set to either 0 or 1:

  allow_at_in_phrase         - Allow '@' in the 'phrase' part of addresses
                               like this:   ph@rase <user@example.com>
  allow_bang_paths           - Allow old-style UUCP electronic-mail 
                               addresses like this:  abcvax!defvax!user
  allow_comments_after_route - Allow (illegal) e-mail addresses like this:
                                 <user@example.com> comment
                               (the address is illegal because the comment
                               should be before the <user@example.com> 
                               part and not after it.)
  allow_ending_dot           - Allow a dot at the end of an e-mail address
                               e.g. like this:  user@example.com.
  limit_length               - Limit the length of 'user' and 'host' parts
                               of user@host e-mail addresses to 64 
                               characters each, as required by section 
                               4.5.3 of RFC821.
  require_fqdn               - Require fully qualified domain names.
  strict_domain_check        - Check for valid top-level domain and for 
                               correct syntax of domain-literals. 

  NOTE: Checking for a valid top-level domain is currently done by means of
        a table which is hard-coded at the end of this file, and which might
        possibly be outdated by the time you''re reading this.

Example:

  $av = new Mj::Addr
    (
     allow_at_in_phrase          => 0,
     allow_bang_paths            => 0,
     allow_comments_after_route  => 0,
     allow_ending_dot            => 0,
     limit_length                => 1,
     require_fqdn                => 1,
     strict_domain_check         => 1,
    );

=cut
sub new {
  my $type  = shift;
  my $class = ref($type) || $type;
  my $self  = {@_};
  my $log = new Log::In 150;
  bless $self, $class;
  $self;
}

=head2 params

This sets the validator parameters.  For bootstrapping purposes these must
be settable separately from allocation.

=cut
sub params {
  my $self = shift;
  my %params = @_;
  my($key, $val);
  while (($key, $val) = each %params) {
    $self->{$key} = $val;
  }
}

=head2 validate

Intended to check an address for validity and report back problems in a way
that the user can understand.  This is hard to do.  This routine tries to
do a "good job" in that it catches most forms of bad addresses and doesn''t
trap anything that is legal.  Some configuration variables are provided to
control certain aspects of its behavior and to allow certain types of
illegal addresses that are commonly allowed.

It currently does not properly handle non-ASCII characters in comments and
hostnames, nor does it handle address groups and route addresses with more
than one host.
