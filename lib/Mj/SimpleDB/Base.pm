=head1 NAME

Mj::SimpleDB::Base - Useful database routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains some routines common to many of the SimpleDB backends.
These include routines to import and export a database to and from a
filehandle.

=cut

package Mj::SimpleDB::Base;
use Mj::Log;
use strict;
#use vars qw(@ISA);


=head2 export

=head2 import

=head2 lookup(key, fileh)

This checks to see if a stripped key is a member of the list, and
returns a reference to a hash containing the subscriber data if so.  If the
optional second parameter is given, it is taken as an already open
filehandle to use.

=cut
sub lookup {
  my $self = shift;
  my $key  = shift;
  my $fh   = shift;
  my $log = new Log::In 500, "$key";

  my $ex = $self->lookup_quick($key, $fh);
  return $self->_unstringify($ex) if defined $ex;
  return;
}

sub lookup_regexp {
  my $self = shift;
  my $key  = shift;
  my $fh   = shift;
  my $wb   = shift; # Should fake matches be written back (the backend may
                    # not need this, but the text backend does)

  my ($match, $ex) = $self->lookup_quick_regexp($key, $fh, $wb);

  return ($match, $self->_unstringify($ex)) if defined $match;
  return;
}

=head2 _stringify(hashref), _unstringify(string) PRIVATE

These convert between a ref to a hash containing subscriber data and a
string.  This string is composed of the legal fields separated by tabs.
These routines are responsible for deciding the actual data representation;
change them with care.

The given hashref is modified.

These routines should be as fast as possible.

If an optional second paramater is passed to _stringify, the changetime
will not be updated.

=cut
sub _stringify {
  my $self     = shift;
  my $argref   = shift;
  my $nochange = shift;

  my ($i, $string);

  # Supply defaults
  $argref->{'changetime'} = time unless $nochange;

  $string = "";

  # Could this be done with map?
  for $i (@{$self->{'fields'}}) {
    $string .= defined($argref->{$i}) ? $argref->{$i} : '';
    $string .= "\001";
  }
  
  $string =~ s/\001$//;
  $string;
}

sub _unstringify {
  my $self = shift;
  my @args = split("\001", shift, @{$self->{fields}});
  my $hashref = {};

  for my $i (@{$self->{'fields'}}) {
    $hashref->{$i} = shift(@args);
  }
  $hashref;
}
