=head1 NAME

Mj::AddressList.pm - A list of addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This encapsulates a simple list of addresses, stored with a comment.  This
is intended to be used for things like lists of allowed posters, or lists
of banned addresses.

One might think of ways to allow regular expressions in addition to
addresses, to match whole domains.  Not yet.

This simply inherits most of the work from SimpleDB.

=cut

package Mj::AddressList;
use Mj::SimpleDB;
use strict;
use vars qw(@ISA);

@ISA=qw(Mj::SimpleDB);

my @fields = qw(stripaddr comment changetime);

=head2 new(path)

This allocates an AddressList by making a SimpleDB object with the fields
we use.

=cut
sub new {
  my $type  = shift;
  my $class = ref($type) || $type;

  my $path = shift;
  my $back = shift;

  new Mj::SimpleDB(filename => $path,
		   backend  => $back, 
		   fields   => \@fields,
		   compare  => \&compare,
		  );
}

sub compare {
  reverse($_[0]) cmp reverse($_[1]);
}
