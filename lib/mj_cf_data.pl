mj_cf_data.pl - data for configuration file manipulation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains the data on the configuration keys that are accepted by
the configuration parser.  It is not intended to be edited by the end user;
use mj_cf_local.pl instead.

A single hash of hashes is used to store the data.  The following hash
keys are used:

 type    - the data type stored in the variable
 values  - the set of allowed values for type enum variables
 groups  - the group memberships of the variable
 comment - an instructional comment
 local   - true if the variable is list-specific.
 global  - true if the variable is part of the global Majordomo config
           (note that a variable may be both local and global).
 visible - True if the variable is visible without password validation.
 mutable - True if the list owner can change the variable; otherwise,
           only someone with a global password can change it.

$std_access_desc = <<EOC;
One of three values: open, list, closed.  Open allows anyone access to this
command.  List allows only list members access, while closed completely
disables the command for everyone.

If this is on, users that are subscribed to a list will always be
shown that list, regardless of any advertise restriction; the list's
advertise restrictions will not even be consulted.  This can result in
a performance increase.

If this is off, the list's advertise restrictions will be consulted
normally.  This will still result in the same behavior unless an
access_rules entry is used to override the normal processing of
advertise/noadvertise, but list owners will then have the choice.

This controls just what actions the list owner will be informed of and
what will be logged.  The format of each line is:

request | status | actions

where request is subscribe, lists, post, etc., status is a comma
separated list of:

  succeed: perform the actions if the request succees.
  fail:    perform the actions if the request fails.
  stall:   perform the actions if the request is stalled.
  any:     always perform the actions

and actions is a comma separated list of:

  ignore: completelu ignore the request
  report: log the request for later reposting
  inform: inform the owner immediately

ignore overrides the others.

If a request is not specified, the default behavior for subscribe and
unsubscribe is to inform on success, report otherwise.  The default
behavior for all other requests is to report always.  This
approximates the 1.9x behavior.

Note that all actions are logged; this only affects which actions are
deemed important enough to send mail about and which will be reported.

    'global' => 0,
    'mutable'=> 1,
    'comment'=> <<EOC,

A table containing attachment rules, which describe how various MIME
types are to be treated when they appear in messages sent to the list.

A rule consists of a MIME type (or regular expression matching a MIME
type) and a list of actions to perform when a message with this type
or containing a part of this type passes through the list.  It looks
something like this:

mime/type | action=argument

Some MIME types are:

text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, video/mpeg

Possible actions are:

  allow     - let the part pass
  deny      - reject the entire message
  discard   - remove the part from the message and pass the rest
  consult   - send the entire message to the list owner for approval
  (more are planned)

allow and consult take an argument; if present, it should be a
content-transfer-encoding.  Majordomo will change the encoding of the
part to match before it is sent.  Some valid encodings are "8bit",
"base64", "quoted-printable", "x-uuencode" and "x-gzip64".  If an
argument is not provided, the encoding will be left as is.  Due to the
nature of MIME, be aware that the encoding can be changed at any
machine that the message passes through, so the encoding you choose
will not necessarily be the encoding that list members will see (and
some may see different encodings than the others).

Note that the first matching rule is the one that is used and types
are by default allowed if no rule matches.  Deny and consult rules are
applied first, and discard rules always apply, even for approved
messages.

Note also that deny and consult just set variables that can be checked
in access_rules.  The default rule for posting normally takes care of
these, but if you add any additional rules is is possible to override
the checks made here.

    'mutable'=> 0,
    'comment'=> <<EOC,

A table containing delivery rules, which describe how Majordomo will
deliver mail.  In the simplest form, you can specify a host to use for
delivery and a batch size.  (This duplicates much of the functionality
of bulk_mailer, for those familiar with it.)

More complicated forms allow you specify a list of hosts to be used
for parallel delivery, and to specify more powerful batching
parameters.

The most general form allows various addresses to be directed to
different sets of hosts for delivery.

Each delivery destination should begin with a line containing either a
regular expression, or the word ALL.  Addreses are compared against
these in order; the first matching destination is chosen.  This
enables you to choose which addresses go to which sets of hosts.

The remaining lines (up until the next blank) should consist of
various parameters which affect delivery.  The possible parameters
are:

numbatches=N
  Split the address list up into exactly N batches.

maxaddrs=N
  Split the list into batches of N addresses apiece.

maxdomains=N
  Split the address list into batches of N domains apiece.  This
  differs from maxaddrs in that a batch can contain more than N
  addresses if several of them are in the same domain.  This requires
  a sorted address list to function completely.

minseparate=N
  If a domain appears more than N times in various addresses, they
  will all be given a separate batch.  This can improve the average
  delivery time quite a bit if you have many addresses at large
  providers, since they will be delivered immediately without waiting
  for other addresses.

  Domains that do not appear more than N times are batched according
  to maxdomains, which should also be specified in order to set the
  batch size for the infrequently occurring hosts.  If maxdomains is
  not also specified, maxdomains=20 is used.

If neither of the above are specified, the default is numbatches=1,
which duplicates the Majordomo 1.x behavior.

hosts=(hosta, hostb, hostc)
  A list of hostnames that Majordomo will connect to to deliver
  batches.  If no hosts are given, Majordomo connects to localhost.

  Batches are delivered to each host in turn in a round-robin fashion.
  (Future enhancements will deliver batches to each host
  simulataneously to compensate for possible delays from individual
  hosts due to load or network traffic.)

  The hosts in this list are randomly reordered, so even if you use a
  single batch the load will be spread out over several messages.

backup=(hostd, hoste, hostf)
  A list of backup hosts to use in case one or more of the regular
  delivery hosts are down.  These will normally be ignored, but if
  there is a problem contacting one of the normal delivery hosts,
  these hosts will be used in addition to the other working hosts.  In
  the event that no host is contactable, Majordomo will attempt to
  contact localhost.  If that fails, Majorodmo will sleep for ten
  minutes and try the whole process again.

sort
  Sort the address list.  Many of the batching options depend on
  getting the addresses in sorted order and will not work as expected
  if the address are unsorted.  Including the sort option causes the
  list to be sorted, but beware that this takes time and memory.  This
  is not necessary (and will have no effect) when using a sorted
  database backend.  A reasonable balance can be struck by sorting the
  list periodically (using the sortlist command) and not sorting here.

Hosts in either the hosts or backup lists can also be specified with
additional information, as follows:

hosts=(hosta=(parameter1, param2=5), hostb=(param3), hostc)

The host parameters are as follows:

esmtp      - speak ESMTP with the hosts if it is able.
onex       - send ESMTP ONEX to the host if it supports it.
pipelining - send the ESMTP PIPELINING command to the host.
timeout    - the number of seconds to wait when opening a connection
             to the host
port       - the port number to connect to, if different from the
             usual SMTP port.

If, instead of a host name, the string "\@qmail" is used, Majordomo
will open a direct connection to the qmail-queue program and directly
inject the message into the qmail delivery system.  This assumes, of
course, that you are running qmail.

Examples (these are all separate):

Duplicate bulk_mailer:
ALL
sort, maxdomains=20

Use a remote exploder for Scandinavia:
/(\.fi|\.no|\.se)$/
hosts=(nordland.no=(esmtp, onex), reallycold.se)
backup=(my.host.com)
numbatches=2

ALL
numbatches=1
hosts=(my.host.com)

Data on the various digests that the list supports.  A digest is
defined by a name, a description, and several pieces of data that tell
Majordomo when an issue should be generated.  The following data can be given:

name     - A one-word name given to the digest.  It is unwise to name
           the digest "mime" or "nomime".

minsizes - The minimum amount of data (measured in messages or
           kilobytes) which must be collected before a digest will be
           generated.  10m gives a minimum size of 10 messages; 20k
           gives a minimum size of 20 kilobytes, and 10m, 20k will
           create a digest when either 10 messages or 20 kilobytes
           of message data have been collected.  The default is no
           minimum.

maxsizes - The maximum size of digest that will be created.  Specify
           either messages or kilobytes or both as with minsizes.  The
           default is no maximum.

maxage   - If an article is older than this, a digest will be created
           even if enough messages have not been collected.  This
           prevents messages from becoming "stale" on low traffic
           lists.  Specify hours like 12h, days like 4d and weeks like
           2w.  The default is no maximum age.

minage   - A digest will not be created if it most recent article is
           younger than this.  This is intended to prevent digest
           creation in the middle of active discussion.  The default
           is no minimum age.

runall   - Controls whether or not only one digest is created, or if
           digests are created until the pool of messages is exhausted
           to the point that the minimum digest size cannot be met.
           The default is to create multiple digests if necessary.

mime     - This specifies whether new subscribers recive the digest in
           MIME mode by default.  Subscribers can still specify MIME
           or non-MIME delivery explicitly.

time     - The times that digests are allowed to be created.  Times are
           specified as following:

            an integer from 0 to 23: digests will be created once,
            after this hour of the day.

            two integers separated by a dash: digests will be created
            anytime between these two hours.  If the second number is
            less than the first, the range continues into the next
            day.

            the name (or a unique portion) of a day of the week, or a
            day of the month (as an ordinal): digests will be created
            anytime during that day.  fri, tue, 1st, 26th

            a construct like fri(6) or 22nd(12-18) limits digest
            creation to those hours on those days.

           Commas can be used to make lists of hours or days, so you
           can have:

            mo(6,8,10), tu(12-18,22-6), we, 3rd(4,10-14)

           The default is to allow digest creation without regard to
           time.

These settings take precedence in the following order:

  A digest is always created when triggered if there is a waiting
  message older than 'maxage', even if this means violating minimum
  size limits.

  Otherwise, digests will only be created if there are enough messages
  (minsizes), the last mesage which would be included in the digest is
  old enough (minage) and the time is right (time), meaning that the
  day is proper and either the hour is in a given range or a single
  hour was given and no digest has been triggered in that hour.

Each digest is defined by two lines.  The first contains data in the
following order, separated by vertical bars (\'|\') or colons:

name    | minsizes | maxage | maxsizes | minage | runall | mime | time

The second line holds a description of the digest.

Here is an example, defining two digests:

daily   | 20K, 5m  | 3d     | 40K, 10m |        | no     | no   | 23
The test-list daily digest
weekly  | 20k, 5m  |        | 100k,30m |        | yes    | yes  | fr(23)
The test-list weekly digest

The second should be either "N", meaning that the file will be sent as
a separate piece of mail, or "P", meaning that the file will be
attached to the previous file.  The default is "N".  In addition, an
"S" can be added, indicating that the file should undergo variable

This provides a search-path mechanism for filename lookup.  Entries are of
the form

  list:path

where \'list\' is the name of a list and path is the path within the
list\'s filespace.  \'list\' can be empty, in which case this list is used.
\'path\' can be empty, in which case the root of the filespace is used.
Thus \':\' refers to the top of the filespace of this list.

To access files of another list, that list must must contain this
list\'s name in its file_share variable.  If the referenced list does
not share with this list, the relevant entries will be ignored.

If \'\$LANG\' appears in the path portion, it is expanded to the user\'s
current language choice if one is available.  If one is not available,
entries containing \'\$LANG\' will be ignored.

Certain directories of the GLOBAL list are always searched to provide
defaults; these directories correspond to the following entries:

  GLOBAL:\$LANG
  GLOBAL:
  GLOBAL:stock/\$LANG
  GLOBAL:stock/en

This variable controls how often bounce probes are sent out.

Bounce probing entails sending specially formatted messages such that the
address causing a bounce is immediately obvious when the bounce is
received.  This requires that each mail transaction send to only one
address, which places additional load on the mail server.  To counter this,
bounce probing is implemented in an incremental fashion.

The address list is split into \'bounce_probe_frequency\' pieces, and a
different piece is probed for each message sent to the list.  This lowers
the overall load while still allowing complete probes to be done in a
reasonable amount of time.

The proper setting depends on a number of factors; it is generally
desireable to probe the entire list once every several days and definitely
not more frequently than once a day.  Thus this should not be set lower
than the expected number of messages per day.  The upper bound depends on
how much additional load the mail server(s) can tolerate.

Setting this to zero disables regular bounce probing.  Setting this to one
probes every address for every message and may place an extreme load on the
server(s).  Note that this variable will be ignored if the MTA is qmail,
because qmail does an equivalent kind of bounce probing itself.
