# This is the place where a user should put code that will extend the email
# interface.  You can execute any legal Perl code here and do essentially
# anything.

# For example, this adds a new alias:
#%aliases =
#  (%aliases,
#   'abonarse' => 'subscribe',
#  );

# You can add support for a new command by adding elements to %commands and
# defining the finction that takes the command line and turns it into the
# proper arguments for the internal function (which you should define
# elsewhere so that it becomes available to other clients).

# XXX WHERE IS "ELSEWHERE"??!!  Decide this.

# You need this 1 here.
