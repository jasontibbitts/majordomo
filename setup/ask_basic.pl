  #---- Ask for startperl
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where is Perl located on this system?
EOM
  $def = $config->{startperl};
  unless ($def) {
    $def = $Config{startperl};
    $def =~ s/[\#\!]*\s*(\S+).*/$1/;
    unless (-x $def) {
      $msg .= "
Normally the default answer to this question is taken
from the 'startperl' variable in Config.pm (containing
\"$Config{startperl}\" which is supposed
to be correct in any proper Perl installation.
Your installation does not seem to be correct.
";
      $def = '';
    }
  }

  # Get an existing executable without searching $PATH, force existing.
  $config->{startperl} = get_file($msg, $def, 1, 1, 0, 1);

  #---- Ask for UID
  $msg = <<EOM;

What is the user ID that Majordomo will run as?
 Either the numeric ID or the user name is fine.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'uid'} ||
    (getpwnam("majordom") && "majordom") ||
      (getpwnam("lists") && "lists");
  $config->{'uid'} = get_uid($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask for GID
  $msg = <<EOM;

What is the group ID that Majordomo will run as?
 Either the numeric ID or the group name is fine.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'gid'} ||
    (getgrnam("majordom") && "majordom") ||
      (getgrnam("lists") && "lists");
  $config->{gid} = get_gid($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask about wrappers
  $msg = <<EOM;

Should the SETID wrappers be installed?
 Majordomo needs to be able to run as the proper user no matter who is
  running it.  This requires that it be installed SETID.  On some systems,
  the Majordomo programs can be installed SETID, but this requires both
  that the operating system support it ant that perl be built to support
  it.  If this is not possible, a set of tiny wrapper programs can be built
  which will take care of the SETID needs of Majordomo.
 If you\'re not sure of how to answer this question, just answer YES.
  There is no loss of functionality when the wrappers are enabled.  Curious
  users may want to answer NO; if wrappers are required, the installation
  process will fail later.

Install the wrappers? 
EOM
  $def = defined($config->{'wrappers'}) ? $config->{'wrappers'} : 1;
  $config->{'wrappers'} = get_bool($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask for umask
  $msg = <<EOM;

What umask should Majordomo use?
 The umask is the Unix method of restricting the permissions on newly
  created files and directories.
 Useful values are:
  077 (nobody except Majordomo can read any Majordomo files)
  027 (users in the Majordomo group can read the files)
  007 (users in the Majordomo group can read and write the files)
 Choose 077 for maximum security.  Majordomo2 can operate with very strict
  permissions.

What should umask be set to?
EOM
  $def = $config->{'umask'} || '077';
  $config->{'umask'} = get_enum($msg, $def, [qw(077 027 007 002 000)]);

  #---- Ask for insecure stored passwords
  $msg = <<EOM;

For developers: the install process needs to know various passwords.
 They can either be saved along with the rest of your install
  configuration, or prompted for at the end of the installation.  Saving
  your passwords can save typing if you are installing repeatedly (as
  happens during development) but this leaves the passwords in the build
  directory which can compromise security.
 If you choose to save your passwords, the .mj_config file will be created
  with strict permissions.

Should the installer save your passwords?
EOM
  $def = $config->{save_passwords};
  $config->{save_passwords} = get_bool($msg, $def);
  unless ($config->{save_passwords}) {
    # Just in case, clean out any stored passwords.
    for my $i (@{$config->{'domains'}}, keys(%{$config->{'domain'}})) {
      warn "Nuking $i";
      delete $config->{'domain'}{$i}{'master_password'};
    }
  }

  #---- Get site password
    $msg = <<EOM;

Please choose a site password.
  Majordomo allows a single site password that allows the holder to perform
  any function on any list in any virtual domain at the site, in addition
  to various more specific passwords.  It should be chosen with care.  It
  can be of arbitrary length, but cannot contain spaces.

EOM
  $def = $config->{'site_password'};
  if ($config->{save_passwords}) {
    $config->{'site_password'} = get_str($msg, $def);
  }
  else {
    delete $config->{'site_password'};
  }

  #---- Ask for default install location
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where will the Majordomo libraries, executables and documentation be kept?
 This could be something like \"/usr/local/majordomo\"; Majordomo will make
   this directory and several directories under it to hold its various
   components.
 Note that this is not necessarily where your lists must be stored.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'install_dir'};
  $config->{'install_dir'} = get_dir($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask for list directory
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where will the Majordomo list data be kept?
 Note that under this directory will be a directory for each domain your
   site supports, and under that a directory for each list at your site.
 Note also that this should _not_ be a directory containing lists
   maintained by Majordomo 1.x, as Majordomo 2 stores its lists in a
   different format.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'lists_dir'};
  $config->{'lists_dir'} = get_dir($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask for writable temporary dir
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where can Majordomo place temporary files?
 Majordomo occasionally needs to write out short-lived files in a place
   that all users can write to.  These files are generally small and are
   deleted after the operations are complete.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'wtmpdir'} || "/tmp";
  $config->{'wtmpdir'} = get_dir($msg, $def);

  #---- Ask for secure temporary dir
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where can Majordomo place secure temporary files?
  Majordomo also needs to write out private temporary files.  For maximum
    security, this should be a special directory that is neither readable
    nor writable by normal users.  (In other words, it should not be /tmp
    unless you know what you\'re doing.)  Many security problems can arise
    when any user can create files and links in the temporary directory with
    the same names that Majordomo would use.
  The installation process will create this directory if it does not exist,
    but will not enforce any permissions.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'tmpdir'} || "$config->{'wtmpdir'}/mj";
  $config->{'tmpdir'} = get_dir($msg, $def);
  $config->{'lockdir'} = "$config->{'tmpdir'}/locks";

  #---- Ask for cgi-bin directory
  $msg = <<EOM;

Where is the web server\'s cgi-bin directory?
  Majordomo comes with a program that enables users to conform operations
    such as subscriptions by using a web page.  It needs to put this program
    in the proper directory so that the web server will run it.
  If the machine running Majordomo does not also run a web server, leave
    this blank.
EOM
  $def = $config->{cgi_bin} ||
    (-d "/home/www/cgi-bin" && "/home/www/cgi-bin") ||
    (-d "/home/httpd/cgi-bin" && "/home/httpd/cgi-bin") || '';
  $config->{cgi_bin} = get_dir($msg, $def, 1);

  #---- Ask if we can link to cgi-bin
  $msg = <<EOM;

Can Majordomo make a link to the program in cgi-bin?
  Some web servers will allow a link to the file in cgi-bin; others require
    a separate copy.  Majordomo tries to avoid confusion by keeping all of
    its files together but if necessary it will put a separate copy of the
    program.
  If in doubt, just answer no.
EOM
  if ($config->{cgi_bin}) {
    $def = $config->{cgi_link} || 0;
    $config->{cgi_link} = get_bool($msg, $def);
  }

  #---- Ask for MTA
  $msg = <<EOM;

What Mail Transfer Agent will be feeding mail to Majordomo?
 Majordomo needs to know the MTA that you\'re running so that it can suggest
  configuration details.
 Currently supported MTAs are:
  sendmail
  qmail
  (sorry, no more!  Look in MTAConfig.pm and write your own!)
 Enter \'none\' if you use an unsupported MTA.
EOM

  $def = ($config->{'mta'} ||
          (-x '/usr/lib/sendmail'           && 'sendmail') ||
          (-x '/usr/sbin/sendmail'          && 'sendmail') ||
          (-x '/var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject' && 'qmail')    ||
          'none'
         );
  $config->{'mta'} = get_enum($msg, $def, [qw(none sendmail qmail)]);

  if ($config->{'mta'} eq 'sendmail') {
    require "setup/ask_sendmail.pl";
    ask_sendmail($config);
  }
  elsif ($config->{'mta'} eq 'qmail') {
    require "setup/ask_qmail.pl";
    ask_qmail($config);
  }

  #---- Ask for virtual domains
  $msg = <<EOM;

Which domains will this Majordomo installation support?
  Majordomo 2 includes support for virtual domain setups, where one machine
    serves several distinct sets of lists.  You can name these collections
    of lists anything you choose, but it is customary to name them after
    the domains which they serve.
  If you have too many domains to list here, you may add them later.
    Consult the documentation.
  If you do not intend to make use of virtual domains, just enter your
    domain.
  Enter a single domain at a time, or a blank line to end.  Enter a space
    to cancel a default value.
EOM
  $def = $config->{'domains'} || [$Net::Config::NetConfig{'inet_domain'}] || undef;
  $config->{'domains'} = get_list($msg, $def);

  require "setup/ask_domain.pl";
  for $i (@{$config->{'domains'}}) {
    print "\nConfiguring the domain: $i\n";
    ask_domain($config, $i);
  }
}
