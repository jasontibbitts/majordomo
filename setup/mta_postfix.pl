Mail Handling Setup

Should Majordomo maintain your aliases automatically?
 Majordomo can automatically maintain your postfix aliases for you.  You
  still have to do some manual setup (see README.POSTFIX) but this only
  needs to be done once; after that you can add lists without doing any
  configuration whatsoever.
 If you say no, Majordomo  will provide you with information to paste into
  your aliases file when you add new lists.  Saying 'yes' is highly
  recommended

    $def = $config->{'maintain_mtaconfig'} || 1;
    $config->{'maintain_mtaconfig'} = get_bool($msg, $def);

    #---- Ask about virtuser files as well
    $msg = <<EOM;
Mail Handling Setup

Should Majordomo maintain virtual_maps files as well?
 Majordomo can also automatically maintain virtual_maps files for handling
  virtual domains.  If you answer 'yes', these files will be generated and
  the aliases will be adjusted appropriately.  Saying 'yes' is highly
  recommended.

    $def = $config->{'sendmail_maintain_vut'} || 0;
    $config->{'sendmail_maintain_vut'} = get_bool($msg, $def);

  # Technically we should ask about this, but I really doubt that anyone
  # ever changes it from the default.
