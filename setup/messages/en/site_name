Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

How would you describe this domain?

The description is used as a title in the WWW interfaces, and in
confirmation notices and welcome messages, to indicate what site is
being visited.  It could, for example, include the name of the
organization or person who manages the lists, such as "Ruth's Mailing
Lists".
