Basic Security Configuration (setuid)

Should the setuid wrappers be installed?

Some Majordomo programs need to be able to run as the majordomo user
($UID), regardless of who starts the program.  The Majordomo programs can
be installed setuid only if the operating system and the perl program
support it.  If this is not possible, a set of tiny wrapper programs can
be built which will take care of the setuid needs of Majordomo.

If you are not sure how to answer this question, answer yes.
There is no loss of functionality when the wrappers are enabled.
