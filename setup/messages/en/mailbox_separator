What does your MTA use as the mailbox separator?

Majordomo needs to know how it can add additional uninterpreted data to
the local part of an address.  This is generally a configuration option
of your MTA.

For example, if the separator is '+', mail sent to the address 'foo+bar'
will reach the user 'foo'.  If it is '-', then mail to 'foo-bar' will
reach 'foo'.

Majordomo uses this feature to attach data about the message and the
recipient to the SMTP envelope.   When a delivery fails, Majordomo uses
this extra data to identify the e-mail address that failed with greater
accuracy.
