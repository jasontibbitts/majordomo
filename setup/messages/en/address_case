Mail Handling Setup

Would you like Majordomo to ignore case in e-mail addresses by default?

If you say yes, for example, "ruth@example.com" and "RUTH@example.com"
will be considered the same address.

If you say no, "ruth@example.com" and "RUTH@example.com" will be
considered different addresses.  This approach complies with Internet
e-mail standards, but may cause problems if a subscriber's address 
changes case.

Answering yes is recommended.
