**** Majordomo needs a properly configured Perl system.

We tried to use the Sys::Syslog module, but it failed with the following
error:

$ERROR

Errors here are generally problems with the Perl installation.
Sys::Syslog requires the file syslog.ph, which is supposed to be generated by
running the h2ph program.  If syslog.ph was not found, it can be
generated by executing the following two commands as root:

  cd /usr/include 
  h2ph * sys/*

Some systems may additionally require the following command:

  h2ph machine/*

and possibly the same for other directories containing headers.

If there was a syntax error, it is possible that h2ph generated improper
code.  This should be investigated and possibly reported to the perl
developers.

Consult the Perl documentation for further information.  Majordomo will
not run until this is fixed.
