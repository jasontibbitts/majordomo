Location of Configuration File (majordomo.cf)

Where should Majordomo keep its system configuration file?


Majordomo keeps some settings in a system configuration file, generally
 called majordomo.cf and generally located in the "/etc" directory.
If the directory this file is to be placed does not exist, it will be
 created and owned by the Majordomo user.  If, instead, the directory
 already exists, Majordomo will not alter it.  This may affect who is able
 to write the Majordomo configuration file.
If you do not intend to install Majordomo as the root user, please
 specify a different location.
