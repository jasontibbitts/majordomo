Virtual Domains

Which domains will this Majordomo installation support?

Majordomo 2 includes support for virtual domain setups, where one
machine serves several distinct sets of lists.  You can name these
collections of lists anything you choose, but it is customary to name
them after the Internet domains which they serve.

If you have too many domains to list here, you can add them later by
running the "make domain" command.  Consult the README file for more
information.  If you do not intend to make use of virtual domains, just
press the enter key.

Domain names can contain any combination of letters, digits, periods,
and hyphens.  Any other character is invalid.

Enter a single domain at a time, or a blank line to end.  Enter a space
to cancel a default value.
