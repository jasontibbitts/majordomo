Storage Locations

Where will the Majordomo list data be kept?

This directory will have a subdirectory for each domain your site
supports.  Each domain's directory will have a subdirectory for each
mailing list in that domain.

This directory should not be a directory containing lists maintained by
Majordomo 1, because Majordomo 2 stores its lists in a different format.
