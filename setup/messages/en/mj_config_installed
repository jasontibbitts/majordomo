I have found a copy of the site-wide configuration information in
  $LIBDIR/.mj_config

Do you want to use the configuration information in that file?  

If you answer yes, the configuration information in that file will
be used to replace the configuration file in the source directory.

Unless you have changed the site-wide configuration using the installed
setup scripts, answer no.
