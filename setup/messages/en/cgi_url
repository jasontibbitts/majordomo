Web Component Setup

What is the URL of the web server's cgi-bin directory?

Majordomo needs to know how to make a URL that refers to a program in
the cgi-bin directory of your web server.  For example, if you can reach
the "blah.cgi" program at this location:
  http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/blah.cgi
you would enter the following value:
  http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/
