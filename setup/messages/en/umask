Basic Security Configuration (umask)

What umask should Majordomo use?

The umask is the Unix method of restricting the permissions on newly
created files and directories.

Choices include:
  077  Only the majordomo user ($UID) can read any Majordomo files.
  027  Users in the majordomo group ($GID) can read the files.
  007  Users in the majordomo group can read and write the files.
  002  Users in the majordomo group can write the files, and anyone
       can read them.
  000  Anyone can read or write the files.

Choose 077 for maximum security.  Majordomo operates well with restricted
permissions.
