Site Configuration

When Majordomo is installed, some information that applies to every
Majordomo domain is saved in the site configuration file.  This file is
located at
  $FILE

The following series of questions will allow you to revise the MTA
information or the site master password.  After you have answered all of
the questions, a copy of your answers will be saved in the .mj_config
file in the current directory.  You will then be given the option of
updating the site configuration file.
