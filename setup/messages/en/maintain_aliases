MTA Configuration

Should Majordomo maintain your aliases automatically?

Majordomo can automatically maintain your aliases for you.  You still
have to make some manual changes (see README.$MTA), but this only needs
to be done once; after that you can add lists without doing any
additional configuration of the MTA. 

If you say no, Majordomo will provide you with information to paste into
your aliases file when you create or rename mailing lists.
