Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

Do you have Majordomo 1.x lists to convert?

You can convert your old Majordomo 1 lists into the new format using the
convertlist.pl script.  Although it is optional, answering a couple of
questions now about your Majordomo 1 installation can make the
conversion process easier.  See the README.CONVERSION help file for more
details.
