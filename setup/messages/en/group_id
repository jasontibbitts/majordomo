Basic Security Configuration (group)

What is the name or number of the majordomo group?

The files and directories created by the final installation step will be
owned by this group.

When you run the "make install" command to install the software, you
must have sufficient privileges to change the ownership of files and
directories to this group.

The group you specify here must already exist.

You appear to be group "$GROUP", with ID "$GID".

What is the group ID that Majordomo will run as?
Either the numeric ID or the group name is fine.
