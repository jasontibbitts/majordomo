Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

Do you want to create this domain now?

If you answer yes, you must have sufficient permissions to create
the directories and update the configuration information for
this domain.

If you answer no, the answers to your previous questions will be
saved, and you or someone else can install the domain later.
