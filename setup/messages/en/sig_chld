Mail Handling Setup

Does $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE' reap children on your system?

On most systems, simply ignoring signals about the status of child
processes will cause the system to clean them up for you.  On some,
however, this will not happen and Majordomo must use a slightly messier
method.

If you do not know the answer, say yes.  If mj_queueserv starts to
accumulate zombie children, reinstall and answer no to this question.
