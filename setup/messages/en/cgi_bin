Web Component Setup

Where is the web server's cgi-bin directory?

Majordomo comes with three WWW interfaces that enable subscribers and
administrations to confirm Majordomo commands, subscribe to mailing
lists, manage mailing lists, and many other features.  These programs
must be stored in the proper directory so that the web server can run
them.

If the machine running Majordomo does not also run a web server, leave
this blank.  Otherwise, you must specify the complete path of the
directory.
