Welcome to the Majordomo 2 configuration system.

In order to configure Majordomo properly when it is installed, we 
need to know some information about your system.

If you have configured Majordomo 2 before, your previous answers will be
taken from the ".mj_config" file in this directory.  The default answer
for each question will be presented in square brackets.  To accept a
default answer, simply press the enter key.  Otherwise, you will need
to type the correct answer to a question before you press the enter 
key.  

There are about twenty basic questions about your site, and about ten
additional questions that are specific to each virtual domain that you
wish to support with Majordomo 2.

Please read each question carefully.  If any of the questions are
unclear, send a polite request for help to the software developers at 
mj2-dev@lists.mj2.org.

Press the enter key to continue.
