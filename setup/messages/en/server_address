Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

At what e-mail address should Majordomo receive mail?

This is the address to which list server commands will be sent.

It should be different from the e-mail address of the Majordomo user,
to prevent cron messages from being processed for commands.

If you are using the "majordomo" address to serve Majordomo 1
lists, you may want to run Majordomo 2 at a different address,
such as "mj2".

You can specify a full e-mail address, or just the local part.  If you
omit the domain name, "@$WHEREAMI" will be appended to 
the address automatically.
