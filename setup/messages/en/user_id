Basic Security Configuration (user)

What is the name or number of the Majordomo user?

The files and directories created by the final installation step will be
owned by this user, and cron jobs for digests and other periodic tasks
must be run as this user.

When you run the "make install" command to install the software, you
must have sufficient privileges to change the ownership of files and
directories to this user.

The user you specify here must already exist.

You appear to be user "$USER", with ID "$UID".

What is the user ID that Majordomo will run as?
Either the numeric ID or the user name is fine.
