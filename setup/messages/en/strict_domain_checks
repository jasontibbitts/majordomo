Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

Should Majordomo do strict domain checking?

Majordomo can perform checks to verify that email addresses include
valid top-level domains.

Normally this should be "yes".  However, if Majordomo is to be running
strictly on an internal network, email addresses may not be required to
have domain names which are valid for the Internet at large.  If that
is the case, answer "no".
