Web Component Setup

Can Majordomo make a link to the programs in the cgi-bin directory?

Some web servers will allow a link to programs in the cgi-bin
directory; others require a separate copy of each program. 
Majordomo tries to avoid confusion by keeping all of its files together.

If you are unsure, answer no.
