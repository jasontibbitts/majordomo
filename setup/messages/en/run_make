Now you should run the following shell commands:
  make         (expect several warnings about truncation to 8 characters)
  make test    (report any problems to mj2-dev@csf.colorado.edu)
  make install (usually as root, answering any questions that appear)

After the software has been installed, save a copy of .mj_config,
  which contains your answers to the configuration questions.

Finally, read the help file for domain administrators with this command:
  $INSTALL_DIR/bin/mj_shell -P help admin_domain
