MTA Configuration
  
Should Majordomo maintain virtual user tables?

Majordomo can also automatically maintain virtual user table files to
allow you to manage multiple virtual domains more easily.  If you answer
yes, these files will be generated automatically and the aliases will be
adjusted appropriately.  You still have to make some manual changes (see
README.$MTA), but this only needs to be done once; after that you can
add lists without doing any additional configuration of the MTA.
