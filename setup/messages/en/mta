Mail Handling Setup

What Mail Transfer Agent will be giving mail to Majordomo?

Majordomo needs to know which MTA is running on this system, to create 
mail aliases and suggest configuration changes.

Currently, the following MTAs are supported:
  exim
  postfix
  qmail
  sendmail

If your system uses zmailer, enter "sendmail".
Otherwise, enter "none" if your system's MTA is unsupported.
