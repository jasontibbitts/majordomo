Configuring the "$DOMAIN" domain

What is the e-mail address of the manager of this domain?
(This address should not begin with "$WHOAMI-owner".)

Mail that is sent to $WHOAMI-owner@$WHEREAMI will automatically be
forwarded to this address.

You can specify a full e-mail address, or just the local part.  If you
omit the domain name, "@$WHEREAMI" will be appended 
to the address automatically.
