Storage Locations

Where can Majordomo place secure temporary files?

Majordomo frequently needs to save temporary files in a private
directory.  For maximum security, chshould be a special directory that
is neither readable nor writable by normal users.  In other words, it
should not be the "/tmp" directory, to which anyone has write access.  

The installation process will create this directory if it does not
exist, but will not enforce any permissions.
