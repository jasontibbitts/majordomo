Basic Security Configuration (passwords)

Should the installer save your passwords?

The configuration process will ask you for site and domain master
passwords.  These passwords can be saved along with the rest of your
answers in the .mj_config file.  Saving your passwords can save typing
if you reinstall Majordomo repeatedly (as happens during development),
but storing the passwords in plain text could potentially compromise
security.

If you answer yes, the .mj_config file will be created with strict
permissions.  If you answer no, you will be asked to type the passwords
again when the software is installed.
