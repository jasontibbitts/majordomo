Mail Handling Setup

Would you like to run Majordomo in queueing mode?

Majordomo can be run in two modes:

In direct mode, every message that arrives is processed immediately by a
new Majordomo process.  No limits are placed on the number of messages
that can be processed concurrently.  Using direct mode can result in a
high system load if many messages arrive at in a short span of time.

In queueing mode, incoming messages are put in a queue to be processed
by a separate program.  Generally queued messages are processed
immediately, but the number of messages processed concurrently is
restricted to save computer resources.  

Use queueing mode?
