# This file contains commands that are run by the postinstall script.
# They create configuration templates for the DEFAULT list to 
# solve common problems related to list configuration.

# When a template is added, make a note of it at the end of the 
# admin_config help file, in the "Templates" section.

# The "comments" setting should contain a description of each
# template.  The width of a description line should be no
# greater than 50 characters.

# DEFAULT:personal:  Place the address of the recipient in the To header.
#   Add a footer that explains how to unsubscribe.

configset DEFAULT:personal comments <<LLL
This template is used to cause a separate copy of
each message posted to a mailing list to be sent
to each subscriber.  The address of the subscriber 
will appear in the "To:" header, and the "Reply-To:" 
header will contain the list's address.

To apply these settings to a mailing list, 
use the following command:

configshow-merge-append DEFAULT:personal YOURLIST

(substitute the name of your mailing list 
for YOURLIST). The "append" mode is necessary 
because the delete_headers setting contains 
existing values.

Because a separate copy of the message is posted 
to each recipient, these settings may strain your 
mail server.  Use with caution.
