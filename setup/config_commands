# This file contains commands that are run by the postinstall script.
# They create configuration templates for the DEFAULT list to 
# solve common problems related to list configuration.

# DEFAULT:personal:  Place the address of the recipient in the To header.
#   Add a footer that explains how to unsubscribe.

configset DEFAULT:personal comments <<LLL
  The "personal" template is used to cause a separate copy of
  each message posted to a mailing list to each subscriber.
  The address of the subscriber will appear in the "To:" header,
  and the "Reply-To:" header will contain the list's address.

  To apply these settings to a mailing list, use the command
    configshow-merge-append DEFAULT:personal YOURLIST
  (substituting the name of your mailing list for YOURLIST.)
  The append mode is necessary because the default delete_headers
  setting contains existing values.

  Because a separate copy of the message is posted to each 
  recipient, these settings may strain your mail server.  Use
  with caution.
